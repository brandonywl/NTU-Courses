Practical Ethics' is a course for students who want to make sense of the idea of right and wrong in a commonsense and practical way that relates to the world we live in (especially in the business context) that is informed by a firm introduction to the main ideas of some of the most important ethical theories.

The first half of the course is an introduction to the elements of ethical reasoning and the main branches of ethical theories and some of their chief modern proponents.  This lays the groundwork for the second half: which will critically apply these concepts thus examined to a consideration of the role of law and ethics in some of the paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  These may include:  corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and child labour (people), international business and public corruption, and environmental sustainability (planet). The seminars will be structured around problems (hypothethical and real) and possibly a few video clips for discussions which are intended to be interesting and engaging whilst providing the context for a serious inquiry into the issues.  Leaders of all kinds, especially those of businesses, are expected in today?s world to be sensitive to ethical dimensions of our reality. This course aims to provide the foundation for such ethical understanding and thinking.

The assessment will be based entirely on coursework: participation, presentation, and a written assignment. There are no prerequisites for the course.

NOTE: "Prospective students should take note that this is a participation intensive course intended for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. Students not prepared to undertake this are not expected to do well.?

We live in a global world, where a premium is placed on the ability to navigate and adapt to differences. Cultural intelligence, CQ is the capability to function effectively across national, ethnic and organizational, organizational cultures (Ang & Van Dyne). IQ and EQ are no longer enough, CQ is becoming a critical predictor for success in the borderless world of the 21st century. The good news is that CQ can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. This course will focus on providing students a conceptual framework for CQ, as well as a set of tools to navigate and explore the world.

At the end of the course, students can expect the following outcomes:-
(1)	A greater understanding of their own motivation, culture, values, and personality, as well
         as their CQ strengths and weaknesses (CQ Motivation & Strategy) 

(2)	Knowledge and experience of how cultures differ in values and behaviours, and how to
         capitalize on similarities, and leverage on the differences (CQ Knowledge);
 
(3)	Enhanced awareness and efficacy of your own communication style in cross cultural
         contexts (CQ Behaviour)

Teaching Method: 

Highly experiential and focused on learning from own self-reflection, class activities and group work, this course focuses on bringing conceptual knowledge to life.

This course provides an overview of the complex relationship between two universal human activities that not only satisfy our basic needs (to survive and to communicate), but have a deep symbolic, often ritualised, cultural component as well. By drawing on linguistics, linguistic anthropology, sociology, cognitive science and media studies, the course introduces the interdisciplinary field of linguistics by examining the interplay between language and food-related practices (food classification and naming, food preparation, eating and drinking) in various historical and socio-cultural contexts around the world. It tells a story of food names and cross-cultural contact and borrowing, of what metaphors are and how they are formed, of the `grammar? of various culinary traditions, of social stratification and symbolic capital as they are related to `food talk?, of regional linguistic variation, and of advertising. The course addresses an engaging topic in order to familiarise students with a number of important social scientific concepts, and to develop their critical thinking skills.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.
