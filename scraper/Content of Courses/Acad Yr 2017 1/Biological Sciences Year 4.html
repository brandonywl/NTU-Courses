This course focuses on 3 main areas:
1.	Introductory to the principles of safety, quality and effectiveness, differences in regulatory framework in some major jurisdictions, healthcare product definitions, and manufacturer responsibilities. Major adverse incidents led to the enactment of healthcare products laws.
2.	Discussion on good manufacturing practice, quality management system and product testing/validation. Understanding experimental design and data analysis is one of the key concepts.
3.	Applying risk management concepts to medical device examples through practical casework.

In this module, students will engineer a large piece of DNA (~40-200kb) using the cutting-edge recombineer techniques. With the engineered DNA molecule, the students will prepare fluorescently labeled probes to carry out an RNA FISH experiment. The experiments involved in this one-week workshop cover the essential techniques of DNA recombineer and fluorescent microscopy, two advanced experimental techniques frequently used in the current molecular biology research. Students are required to perform a systematic series of fundamental molecular biology techniques, including PCR, gel electrophoresis and purification, restriction digestion and nick-translation that constitute part of the labeled-DNA probes preparation for the subsequent RNA FISH experiment. This allows students to have additional trainings in fundamental molecular biology techniques and to be able to apply them in advanced in-situ hybridization studies. The schedule of ?lectures? (instructions) will be coordinately arranged based on each day?s experiments. Each student will need to submit a lab report at the end of the workshop. The students will be graded based on his/her lab report; the results of his/her daily experiments and his/her participation/performance during the workshop.

The aim of this workshop is to let students understand the mechanism of metastasis and the role of actin cytoskeleton regulators in metastasis. Students will carry out experiments to determine the metastatic potential of cancer cells as well as cancer cells treated with N-WASP inhibitors (Wiskostatin and 187-1) and N-WASP knock down cells using different molecular and cell biology experimental techniques. Through a series of experiments, students will appreciate how cancer cells metastasize and how actin regulators can be targeted to inhibit metastasis. As we have limited numbers of microscopes for undergraduate laboratory, the maximum class size will be limited to 20 students. Each student will need to submit a lab report and give a presentation of the findings at the end of the workshop. The students will be graded based on lab report & presentation and participation/performance during the workshop.

Selected topics in immunology will be covered in depth.  Students are expected to read and interpret original research publications and perform extensive literature search on selected topics in immunology.  In addition to the 10 lecturers of selected subjects, this course also requires students to present an assigned research paper and compose an original research proposal.  To accomplish this assignment, students need to carefully study the most recent research findings and be able to identify the unsolved problems or knowledge gaps in the selected reseach field.  Finally they will propose experimental strategies to solve the problems in the research proposal.  In this way, the students are encouraged to utilize the knowledge they have acquired throughout the years, instead of just memorize the facts.

This course aims to introduce students to the different theories about aging and current understanding of the basic aging mechanisms in model organisms and in humans. Students will learn about the recent advances in aging research that underscore some of the interventional strategies aim at extending health- and life-span. Students will also gain a better understanding of physiological aging and age-related diseases. The ultimate goal of this course is to engage students with problems in biology of aging and to inspire them toward aging research to prepare for the rising demand of global aging on public health.

Aging is an integral part of everyone's life. In a way, we are all 'experts' in the aging process, having experience it firsthand ourselves. Despite so, the nature of the aging process remains a mystifying progression to many of us. This course aims to unravel the complexity of the aging process by providing a comprehensive study of the biology of aging. The weekly lecture will explore what happens as we age by looking at changes occurring at the most basic molecular level to alterations in the biological processes that contribute to cellular dysfunction and senescence and consequences of such failures at the organism level. The array of topics include different theories of aging, experimental models used to study aging and longevity, whether the ghost of aging is in our genes by looking at the genetic and epigenetic origins of aging, molecular blueprint of exceptional longevity, relationship between stress resistance and aging, alterations in metabolism and immunity with age, functional changes at the systems level and recent developments in translational research on enhancing health- and life-span.
