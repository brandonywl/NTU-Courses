This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

Since the early 1990s, the Internet has been viewed as an increasingly essential tool to improve public sector performance, stimulate economic growth and facilitate better governance. Many governments worldwide have invested heavily in e-government implementation in order to realize the transformative potential of e-government. In the context of a changing world, the challenges facing governments have increased. Governments are under mounting pressure to strengthen their governing capacities and foster future growth and stability. In an era of crisis and uncertainty, the study of e-government has become more necessary and important than ever before. 

The aims of this course are to enable students to gain both theoretical and empirical knowledge of e-government, and to equip students with critical thinking and problem solving skills to examine key issues in e-government.
