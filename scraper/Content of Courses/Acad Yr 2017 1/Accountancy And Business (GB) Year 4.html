The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

Accounting plays a vital role in business organizations' strive for resources and performance. Through the provision of useful information, accounting helps organizations attract resources from external stakeholders, and helps internal stakeholders manage these resources, to achieve the targeted performance. The process not only facilitates the creation of value for organizations and their stakeholders, it also benefits the economy and society as a whole, by helping to direct resources to where they can be more productive.

Based upon the foundation established in the predecessor course AA101, this course focuses on the relevance of accounting information to internal stakeholders, i.e. management, to make decisions and achieve control in their strive for performance. Emphasis is placed on both the provision, as well as the application, of accounting information.

This course provides students with the conceptual background and analytical skills that are necessary to identify, assess and apply information for the purposes of analysing and valuing business activities and entities.

Emphasis is placed on integrating the use of financial and non-financial information in business valuation and analysis, involving strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial analysis, prospective analysis and valuation. The course allows students to understand the critical issue of determining the specific types of information that are relevant in ex ante valuation and ex post analysis of business entities and their activities.

Effective negotiation skills are important and necessary in one's personal as well as professional life.  This course aims to increase awareness of the negotiation process, to equip the participant with a basic framework with which to analyse and prepare for negotiations, and to help participants develop a more effective negotiating style.  This course also aims to introduce students to the concept of mediation, which is essentially negotiation with the aid of a neutral third party who is skilled in negotiation techniques.

This course adopts a variety of teaching methods.  There will be lectures and discussions, video-screenings of negotiation skills and actual negotiations, experiential learning through role-playing and simulation exercises, written self-review as well as peer and instructor review.  Negotiation exercises are drawn from a variety of contexts ? personal and legal, bilateral and multilateral.  The course will also include a field trip to the Singapore Mediation Centre.

Important Note: 
To get the most out of the course, it is important that participants are well-prepared for class and actually attend the class.  Your lack of preparedness, or absence from class will severely compromise your personal learning experience as well as the experience of the rest of the class and will be viewed very seriously in assessing your final grade. You are required to attend every seminar. You should therefore consider your commitment to the course carefully before signing up. 

As the course uses Harvard Law School materials for the simulation exercises, the cost of acquiring these will be borne by participants. The amount varies depending on the actual exercises used, but it should be about $50 per person. The instructors will provide more details when the course begins.
