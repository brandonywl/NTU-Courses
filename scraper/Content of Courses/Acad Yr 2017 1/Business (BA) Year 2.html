The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

This course introduces the building blocks of negotiation.   Through an active and experiential learning approach, you will not only learn about the theoretical elements of negotiation but have opportunity to put theory into practice every week.    By the end of the course you will have a framework which you will be able to use to prepare for all your future negotiations.   You will get as much out of the course as you put in - through your effort in preparing for the exercises and immersion in the negotiation simulations.

This course introduces participants to analyses, design, tools, techniques, and issues concerning the management of data. Data management is the foundation for organizations? business analytics; and for problem solving and decision-making. Participants will analyse a variety of business process, identify data requirements and develop an information system to support business processes and gather information for business analytics. In this course, participants will have an opportunity to apply their design and development competencies by working closely with non-profit organizations to implement an information systems prototype.

The learning goals of this course are to develop a range of competencies necessary for the domain of business analytics. These competencies include analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills, and technical and interpersonal skills. In-class exercises and the semester project will facilitate the internalization of these competencies. Through cooperative learning and real-world problems, participants will learn to work as consulting teams within a real operating organizational context. More importantly, participants of this course will learn how to learn new concepts, technologies and techniques.

Upon successful completion of this course, participants will have gained competencies to identify and analyze business-related problems, to use appropriate technologies to resolve these problems, to evaluate alternative solutions, to make appropriate recommendations and to develop a prototype of their recommended solution.

This course aims to assist students to explore from strategic, organizational, and technical perspectives the critical issues surrounding network and data infrastructure design, analysis and management.

The course is comprised of three main components - strategic, organizational and technical. The strategic component of the course deals with current ideas in strategic planning and aims to expose students to concepts from strategic studies and how they apply to network and data planning. Specifically, we are interested to study how traditional strategic thinking e.g., Porter's five forces and more recent strategic ideas of new competition and hyper competition relates to use of technologies in designing networked enterprises. Next, we focus on the technical component i.e., the physical view of the networked enterprise. We take an extensive look at the range of infrastructure including LAN, WAN, Mobile, Internet, as well as data centers that support and enable modern networked enterprises. We round up the coursework by looking at the organizational issues surrounding networked enterprises, viz., coordination and integration designs. While these three components are dealt separately, the goal of the course is to enable participants to appreciate how these strategic, technical and organizational issues are intertwined in the design of networked enterprises. As such, students are expected to work through a group project to map strategic and organizational requirements to network design and planning. Industry presentations and/or visits are also planned to bring alive the integrated nature of these issues.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

"Services represent the fastest growing sector of any developed economy. In the United States, this sector is responsible for nearly 75% of GDP and 80% of employment. Similarly, 75% of GDP and 70% of jobs in Singapore are generated by services. This trend persists in other industrialized nations. Moreover, these figures under-represent the actual role and significance of services in the economy because many manufacturing firms are increasingly involved in service-type jobs such as design, distribution, financial planning, customization, and after-sales services. That said, it is important for any manager (or student of management) to understand how services differ from manufacturing operations, and how toefficiently and effectively manage service operations.

In the first 7 weeks of the course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for designing, managing, analyzing, and improving service operations. Students will also learn to use analytical models and decision support tools for improving the operational effectiveness and efficiency in service organizations. Topics covered include Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Quality, Process Management, Project Management, Forecasting, Queue Management, Workforce Scheduling, and Capacity & Demand Management. 

The remaining weeks will focus on understanding the basics of service operations in the hospitality industry. Specific topics such as Front Office Management, F&B Management, Housekeeping, Facility Maintenance, and Revenue Management will be covered in this segment.

The goals of the course are:
1.   to provide an understanding and appreciation of the service functions of firms related to the
      Hospitality and Tourism industry,
2.   to understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to succeed in
      designing and managing service operations. The teaching method used is seminar style
      with a mix of lectures, in-class problem solving, discussions, video showing, and facility
      tours."
