This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

This course is designed to develop the ability to read the main texts of Daoism and to understand contemporary issues related to Daoist philosophy. In Asian countries, the influence of Daoism is pervasive, filtering into literature, philosophy, religion, art and technology. The learning of Daoism is helpful not only for students who want to understand Asian tradition from comparative perspectives but also for those who are devoted to contemporary concerns since growing attention is paid to Daoism in many contemporary fields such as ecology, feminism, and etc. Despite the increasing demand of intellectual approach to Daoism, there has not been a relevant course in the main curriculum. This course will provide a wider and further exploration into intellectual inquiry for Chinese majors and other Humanities students, including philosophy majors who are interested in Chinese philosophy.

Contemporary thinkers in East and West often point out the aesthetic characteristic of Chinese thought. Since Confucius' rehabilitation of Zhou ritual and musical tradition, music and aesthetic thought have held the central position in the intellectual history of China. Chinese aesthetic discourse is much more colorful than generally considered. Various aesthetic issues sprang up and different thinkers contributed their ideas during Warring State period. Therefore, emphasis will be placed on the very period of the formation of Chinese aesthetic thought. Throughout the course, we will explore the fundamental aesthetic issues raised by early Chinese thinkers ? How does music move us? How music can be understood as serving the solidarity of a community? Which aspects can be significantly associated with music? How can music enlist the entire 'self'? Why aesthetic life is necessary for moral cultivation? We will address such issues from the perspective of the thinkers as well as from a perspective informed by contemporary concerns.

This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

The harsh reality of our threatened existence on planet Earth, stemming from a large array of environmentally unfriendly human activities, has lead to an increased interest in how psychology can provide answers about why people behave in environmentally irresponsible ways. Additionally, psychology, as a science of human behavior can be applied to find answers to how human behavior may be changed/altered to promote balance and sustainability on this planet. This course will focus on some key approaches in psychology and how these can be applied to create a more sustainable society.

Our planet is undergoing radical environmental and social changes. Environmental sustainability has now been put into question by, for example, our consumption patterns, loss of biodiversity, depletion of resources, and imbalanced power relations. With apparent ecological and social limits to globalization and development, the current levels of consumption are unsustainable, inequitable, and inaccessible to the majority of humans. Understanding the environmental sustainability is a crucial matter at a time when our planet is in peril - both environmentally and socially. This course will show possible pathways for a sustainable earth.

This introductory course explores what it means to develop the 'sociological imagination'.  Moving beyond an understanding of the biological basis of behaviour, the course develops a perspective of the human person located in 'society' - within webs of social relationships and institutional forms of social organisation.  Social life is governed by norms and constraints, but individuals as social actors also 'make history' and exercise choice in their lives.  In addition, the course develops a comparative understanding of the diversity of societal forms and cultural traditions in human history, especially the key features of modern life and its continued transformation in contemporary times.

This course introduces students to sociological theories, methods, and research through an examination of selected social problems in a global context.  "Social problems" refers to sets of social conditions, arrangements, and practices whose resolution, or mere existence, social actors deem important. "Social problems" are social in two ways. First, social problems are constituted through human interaction. Second, social problems are socially defined and thus the meaning and significance of social problems may be contested. There are some social problems that pose practical (if different) challenges for us all. This course introduces sociological perspectives on social problems relating to poverty and inequality, work and occupations, social welfare, and the constitution and role of government.

This course examines the theoretical foundations of sociology as a discipline. It focuses on the key ideas and perspectives developed by classical social theorists in their analyses of basic features of social life, the making of modern society and the consequences of modernity. In particular, the contributions of major thinkers such as Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber are discussed against the backdrop of the social and intellectual contexts of their times. In understanding the pivotal influence of such contributions on the development of the discipline, the subject also considers their continuing relevance for analysing social change in the contemporary world.

This course explores some fundamental problems in political philosophy. We will examine classic texts written by thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as influential works by contemporary philosophers. All these writings should be appreciated as offering very good answers to difficult moral questions about government, rights, justice, and citizenship. However, as the student will see, the authors often disagree with one another, and no single philosopher's view of things is beyond criticism. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned opinion as to how the problems of the course are best resolved.

What is the right thing to do? What is the fundamental nature of the universe? Are there limits to knowledge? These questions, which we continue to ask today, were also pondered and debated by philosophers over two thousand years ago, and in trying to answer them, they developed sophisticated systems of thought. This course aims to teach students the
views of the highly influential philosophers of ancient Greece, Rome, and other regions of the ancient world. The main philosophers covered will be Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and some of the Pre-Socratics. The course is structured around several topics, including ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

Public policy is any institution, norm, or rule created by a government to guide people?s behavior. The study of public policy raises significant ethical questions. In particular: to what ends should citizens? behavior be guided, and by which means should a government guide such behavior? When might a public policy intervention by the government in the affairs of private individuals be unethical? Ethics and Public Policy will survey a number of areas in which public policy has been used to address social and political issues: crime, immigration, health, safety, inequality, religion, and the family. Students will question, debate, and reflect on the ethical principles which favor or disfavor the implementation of various public policies.
