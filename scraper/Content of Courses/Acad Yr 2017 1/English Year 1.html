This course covers over one thousand years of English writing, from Anglo-Saxon to Neoclassical literature. We will focus primarily on the relationship between ?form? and ?history? in seeking to understand this literature, where ?form? refers to a given text?s genre or mode (e.g., ?revenge tragedy?), its linguistic and narrative characteristics, and so on, while ?history? means both material and cultural formations as these change through time. While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature?from deconstruction to queer theory?might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works. The course will touch upon a number of ?big? themes in English literature, with particular emphasis on the rise of individualism and the impact of the Reformation on early-modern culture and thought.

The Age of Sensibility and Romanticism witnessed a surge of interest in emotional responsiveness, imagination, and individual subjectivity. These inward explorations coincided with a series of political, cultural, and philosophical debates that reconfigured public life and continue to shape our modern sensibilities. Taking taxonomy as an overall theme, this course begins by delineating approaches to perception, articulation, and emotion that emerged during the long eighteenth century. Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children?s books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material. Literary works, such as poetry and fiction, will be examined alongside pedagogical theory and discourses on elocution and aesthetics. Throughout the course, we will consider our own experience as readers of eighteenth-century and Romantic texts in relation to reading practice during the period. How did rising literacy rates and innovations in textual production and circulation influence literary form, genre, and taste?

What do literary scholars and critics do?  How do they approach literature within specific contexts?  How do they communicate with each other and with wider audiences?  What are the differences between Area Studies, Ethnic and National Studies, Cultural Studies, and Comparative Studies of literature?  What is the role of theory in literary study?  These are some of the questions addressed in this module.  Students will be exposed to various ways of reading and writing about literature, including New Criticism, literature and the other arts, structuralism and post-structuralism, new historicism, psychoanalytic and feminist theories, and ethical criticism in order to gain an understanding of the methodologies of literary analysis.

This course analyzes and interprets American culture mostly from the first half of the twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, and film, looking at the way that the conditions of modernity engendered new forms that go beyond the earlier novel/romance dichotomy. We?ll study realism (Cather); naturalism in its classic, modernist, and Depression-era forms (London, Stein, Steinbeck, respectively); as well as classic modernists Eliot, Hemingway, and West, examining their experiments involving perspective, language, history, memory, and the surreal. We?ll study the dark filmic vision of film noir, focusing on patterns of corrupt morality, cold passion, and dehumanizing modernity. The short fiction of the Southern Catholic writer Flannery O?Connor will be discussed in terms of the grotesque and the cultural division of country and city. We?ll read Naked Lunch, Burroughs? shockingly experimental work examining power and addiction. We?ll conclude with a novel by Robinson that evokes a hybrid world of nature and domesticity through non-hierarchical, non-individualized discourse.

This module explores a diverse range of African literatures ? including works from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

The harsh reality of our threatened existence on planet Earth, stemming from a large array of environmentally unfriendly human activities, has lead to an increased interest in how psychology can provide answers about why people behave in environmentally irresponsible ways. Additionally, psychology, as a science of human behavior can be applied to find answers to how human behavior may be changed/altered to promote balance and sustainability on this planet. This course will focus on some key approaches in psychology and how these can be applied to create a more sustainable society.

Our planet is undergoing radical environmental and social changes. Environmental sustainability has now been put into question by, for example, our consumption patterns, loss of biodiversity, depletion of resources, and imbalanced power relations. With apparent ecological and social limits to globalization and development, the current levels of consumption are unsustainable, inequitable, and inaccessible to the majority of humans. Understanding the environmental sustainability is a crucial matter at a time when our planet is in peril - both environmentally and socially. This course will show possible pathways for a sustainable earth.

HW0105 is a foundation course with the broad aim of enabling HASS students to recognise and use an appropriate style of communication in academic settings related to various fields within the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage them to critically evaluate and write about issues from multiple perspectives before they develop their own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as students go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus. This course aims to equip students with the necessary skills for reading and thinking critically and writing effectively by:

1. analysing and evaluating academic texts;
2. cultivating an awareness of audience, context and purpose in writing tasks;
3. developing rhetorical skills relevant to the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in Singapore;
4. engaging with texts from a range of disciplines.
