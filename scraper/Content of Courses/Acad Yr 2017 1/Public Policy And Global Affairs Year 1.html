This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students who have never been exposed to political science studies to the fundamentals of the discipline. In so doing, students in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme (major & minor) will acquire the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical tools that would allow them to think seriously about politics. The ultimate goal is to equip students with essential political ideas and principles and enable them to apply these concepts to studying contemporary political life.

The harsh reality of our threatened existence on planet Earth, stemming from a large array of environmentally unfriendly human activities, has lead to an increased interest in how psychology can provide answers about why people behave in environmentally irresponsible ways. Additionally, psychology, as a science of human behavior can be applied to find answers to how human behavior may be changed/altered to promote balance and sustainability on this planet. This course will focus on some key approaches in psychology and how these can be applied to create a more sustainable society.

Our planet is undergoing radical environmental and social changes. Environmental sustainability has now been put into question by, for example, our consumption patterns, loss of biodiversity, depletion of resources, and imbalanced power relations. With apparent ecological and social limits to globalization and development, the current levels of consumption are unsustainable, inequitable, and inaccessible to the majority of humans. Understanding the environmental sustainability is a crucial matter at a time when our planet is in peril - both environmentally and socially. This course will show possible pathways for a sustainable earth.

HW0105 is a foundation course with the broad aim of enabling HASS students to recognise and use an appropriate style of communication in academic settings related to various fields within the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage them to critically evaluate and write about issues from multiple perspectives before they develop their own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as students go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus. This course aims to equip students with the necessary skills for reading and thinking critically and writing effectively by:

1. analysing and evaluating academic texts;
2. cultivating an awareness of audience, context and purpose in writing tasks;
3. developing rhetorical skills relevant to the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in Singapore;
4. engaging with texts from a range of disciplines.
