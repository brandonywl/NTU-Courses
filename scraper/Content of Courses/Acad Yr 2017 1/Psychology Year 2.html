This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

This course will provide an introductory overview to the field of biological psychology.  Course content will begin by explaining what biological psychology is and why biology is the ultimate basis for the expression of behavior in any living organism. The course will cover the anatomy of the nervous system by exploring the structures of the brain, spine and neurons, and will introduce the basic techniques used by biopsychologists. In addition, the biological foundations of the perceptual and sensorimotor systems will be covered.  The course will also cover the plasticity of the brain and how damage to the brain can influence behavior. We will cover material on the biological basis of motivation, cognition and emotion. We will study how hormones influence behavior, and we will cover the biology of sleep. Lastly, the course will introduce pharmacology, and the neurology of stress and psychological disorders.

Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

The field of sensation and perception investigates the senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell). The brain processes huge amounts of data coming in through our eyes, ears, nose, skin, etc. How does the brain make sense of all this information? This course will focus mainly on visual perception, and cover questions such as: Why do insect eyes look so different from ours? Why does the moon look so big when it?s near the horizon? Why can't I see when I walk into a movie theater from a bright sunny day? How can a batter hit a baseball traveling at 90 mph? Why do some people see that dress as white-gold and others as blue black? What do the brains of blind people process? In understanding the visual system, we will learn common principles of brain function relevant for the other senses, and for understanding human cognition and behavior in general. 

Perception science has a long tradition, and is a great example for inter-disciplinary science, involving the fields of psychology, philosophy, biology, physiology, medicine, anthropology, physics, computer science, and art. In this course, we will cover many aspects of visual experience from many angles, including theories, underlying neural mechanisms, and their scientific evidence.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the rapidly expanding field of child psychopathology.  This will be an introductory module surveying the various childhood disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).  An integrative perspective, acknowledging biological, psychological, social, and emotional influences and their interdependence, will be explored to explain the causes and effects of the presented childhood disorders. In addition, developmental processes that shape and are shaped by the expression of each disorder will be considered, within the context of family, peers, school, community, culture and society. Current approaches to treatment and prevention will also be briefly highlighted.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

Our planet is undergoing radical environmental and social changes. Environmental sustainability has now been put into question by, for example, our consumption patterns, loss of biodiversity, depletion of resources, and imbalanced power relations. With apparent ecological and social limits to globalization and development, the current levels of consumption are unsustainable, inequitable, and inaccessible to the majority of humans. Understanding the environmental sustainability is a crucial matter at a time when our planet is in peril - both environmentally and socially. This course will show possible pathways for a sustainable earth.

This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind -e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an 'identity'.Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.
