The course is designed to introduce students to tourism and hospitality as a human and commercial activity and planning and development issue which affects us all and has important economic, environmental, socio-cultural and political implications. A large and powerful industry is shown to be at work to meet the needs of the leisure and corporate markets, operating globally and characterised by multiple sectors. Subjects to be covered include the structure and organisation of the tourism and hospitality industry and critical challenges for managers. Attention is also given to the scale of tourist movements in the 21st century, tourism's impacts and the need for sustainable development. Emphasis is placed on topical events and issues, revealing the fast-changing nature of the tourism and hospitality business in terms of both demand and supply. Several of the illustrations used are from Singapore, but reference is made to wider regional and global conditions and trends. The course is intended to complement other second year specialisation core courses and acts as a foundation for final year studies.

At the end of the course, students will have an awareness of the complexity of the modern tourism and hospitality industry and an understanding of its dynamics. Insights will have been gained into the problems and opportunities faced by managers in the contemporary world and strategies adopted in response. Students also will be able to demonstrate their knowledge, think creatively and critically about tourism and hospitality management issues and communicate ideas in an effective manner.
