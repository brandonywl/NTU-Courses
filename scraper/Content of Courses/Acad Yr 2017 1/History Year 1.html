This course analyses ideas about gender and sexuality in the modern world, as well as the experiences of modern men and women.  In this course, we rethink modern categorisations of gender and sexuality.  Students will deconstruct dual gender systems through analysing diverse gender roles and multiple genders in different parts of the world.  We will analyse how gender has intersected with various dimensions of modernity, including: class and domesticity; labour; imperialism and race; citizenship and nationalism; sexuality and the body; ideas about crime; and forms of popular culture and mass media.  Students will gain an understanding of how contemporary ideas about gender and sexuality are historically specific.

The course covers a historical timeframe from the 17th through the 21st centuries. The
arrival of the Mayflower at Plymouth in 1620 marks the beginning of this course`s
coverage of American history; the signing of the Mayflower compact marked the
establishment of self-determining government in northeast America. The European view
of "America" clearly began to differ from those of the pilgrims and other settlers, and it
culminated in the American revolution of 1776 which established a new geopolitical
entity, though there was still no unified concept of the United States of America. The
formation of the US was to continue to develop over the next century. The second part
of the course emphasizes the empire-building aspects of the US`s history and its role in
the modern era. Over a few lectures, American empire building programs will be
compared and changes in US strategies and perceptions of their role as an emerging
political and military superpower discussed. Also covered in this course are the socioeconomic
transformations which were taking place within the US during its rise to
prominence in the international arena. Rapid industrialization and the formation and
flourishing of cities should be observed and examined in tandem with US development
into a global superpower. The impact of US imperialism is not restricted to the political,
economic, and military spheres, but also extends to the cultural sphere. The last lecture
will bring the subject to the 21st century and explores the US role in the future.

Advanced students will interrogate the interactions between science and race. The course is presented in three parts that will provide a theoretical and contextual foundation for the study of a topic that spans across diverse geographic locations, periods, and scientific and technological developments. The first four weeks are organized around the question of ?how do we know what we see or experience is what we encounter?? in the context of colonial events. The following five weeks examine issues of measurement, classification, and progress surrounding the construction of race in the 18th and 19th centuries. The final four weeks of this course examine more specific topics, such as gender, medical and technological interventions, and nationhood. At least one other history course highly recommended in preparation of this course.

This course examines the culture, society and politics of Britain after 1945. In a broad sense it explores the political, economic and intellectual consequences of imperial decline. It analyses the ways in which national life both joyfully and painfully adapted to a new world order, and the ways in which new forms of social expression in Britain variously rubbed against, reached an accommodation with, and sometimes enhanced, much older and more far-reaching ambitions to wield influence on an international stage.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

The harsh reality of our threatened existence on planet Earth, stemming from a large array of environmentally unfriendly human activities, has lead to an increased interest in how psychology can provide answers about why people behave in environmentally irresponsible ways. Additionally, psychology, as a science of human behavior can be applied to find answers to how human behavior may be changed/altered to promote balance and sustainability on this planet. This course will focus on some key approaches in psychology and how these can be applied to create a more sustainable society.

HW0105 is a foundation course with the broad aim of enabling HASS students to recognise and use an appropriate style of communication in academic settings related to various fields within the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage them to critically evaluate and write about issues from multiple perspectives before they develop their own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as students go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus. This course aims to equip students with the necessary skills for reading and thinking critically and writing effectively by:

1. analysing and evaluating academic texts;
2. cultivating an awareness of audience, context and purpose in writing tasks;
3. developing rhetorical skills relevant to the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in Singapore;
4. engaging with texts from a range of disciplines.
