This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

This course surveys major scientific and technological developments in various
geographical and cultural contexts, including those of Asia, Europe and the United
States. It examines the transformations in the study of astronomy, medicine and natural
philosophy, and compares the approaches to knowledge and the cultural values
attached to science and technology in different societies. In so doing, it places these
developments in their cultural, social and political contexts. It also surveys the
technological innovation since the industrial revolution and how it has increasingly
become a powerful force in transforming the human conditions.

This course analyses ideas about gender and sexuality in the modern world, as well as the experiences of modern men and women.  In this course, we rethink modern categorisations of gender and sexuality.  Students will deconstruct dual gender systems through analysing diverse gender roles and multiple genders in different parts of the world.  We will analyse how gender has intersected with various dimensions of modernity, including: class and domesticity; labour; imperialism and race; citizenship and nationalism; sexuality and the body; ideas about crime; and forms of popular culture and mass media.  Students will gain an understanding of how contemporary ideas about gender and sexuality are historically specific.

The course covers a historical timeframe from the 17th through the 21st centuries. The
arrival of the Mayflower at Plymouth in 1620 marks the beginning of this course`s
coverage of American history; the signing of the Mayflower compact marked the
establishment of self-determining government in northeast America. The European view
of "America" clearly began to differ from those of the pilgrims and other settlers, and it
culminated in the American revolution of 1776 which established a new geopolitical
entity, though there was still no unified concept of the United States of America. The
formation of the US was to continue to develop over the next century. The second part
of the course emphasizes the empire-building aspects of the US`s history and its role in
the modern era. Over a few lectures, American empire building programs will be
compared and changes in US strategies and perceptions of their role as an emerging
political and military superpower discussed. Also covered in this course are the socioeconomic
transformations which were taking place within the US during its rise to
prominence in the international arena. Rapid industrialization and the formation and
flourishing of cities should be observed and examined in tandem with US development
into a global superpower. The impact of US imperialism is not restricted to the political,
economic, and military spheres, but also extends to the cultural sphere. The last lecture
will bring the subject to the 21st century and explores the US role in the future.

Advanced students will interrogate the interactions between science and race. The course is presented in three parts that will provide a theoretical and contextual foundation for the study of a topic that spans across diverse geographic locations, periods, and scientific and technological developments. The first four weeks are organized around the question of ?how do we know what we see or experience is what we encounter?? in the context of colonial events. The following five weeks examine issues of measurement, classification, and progress surrounding the construction of race in the 18th and 19th centuries. The final four weeks of this course examine more specific topics, such as gender, medical and technological interventions, and nationhood. At least one other history course highly recommended in preparation of this course.

This course examines the culture, society and politics of Britain after 1945. In a broad sense it explores the political, economic and intellectual consequences of imperial decline. It analyses the ways in which national life both joyfully and painfully adapted to a new world order, and the ways in which new forms of social expression in Britain variously rubbed against, reached an accommodation with, and sometimes enhanced, much older and more far-reaching ambitions to wield influence on an international stage.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

The Green Earth covers some of the most important themes in environmental history
which have informed academic scholarship during the last 20 to 30 years. The course
begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and
development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation
of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of
warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had
brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course
focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions
of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to
elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject
of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous
desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and
pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals,
particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction
of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several
millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have
lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at
the end of the course.

Slavery was an important aspect of the social order and political structure of many Indian Ocean societies in the early modern and modern periods.  This course examines diverse types of slavery across the Indian Ocean from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries.  The emphasis in this course is on the everyday lives of slaves at various points in the social spectrum, from powerful slave concubines and slave soldiers, to the drudgery of domestic and agrarian slavery. We will consider issues of identity, community and memory - in particular the efforts of slaves who were separated from their origins to form new communities and identities - and look at instances of slave resistance and rebellion.  The latter part of the course turns to abolitionism in the Indian Ocean and the aftermath of the prohibition of the slave trade. We will see that colonial discourses surrounding slavery were highly ambiguous and examine whether new forms of colonial forced labour, like indentured and convict labour, represented new forms of slavery. Analyzing slavery adds to our understanding of historical transnational links and connections within the Indian Ocean region.  Moreover, examining the everyday lives of slaves will deepen students' knowledge of the lives of marginalized groups in Indian Ocean societies.

There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

The harsh reality of our threatened existence on planet Earth, stemming from a large array of environmentally unfriendly human activities, has lead to an increased interest in how psychology can provide answers about why people behave in environmentally irresponsible ways. Additionally, psychology, as a science of human behavior can be applied to find answers to how human behavior may be changed/altered to promote balance and sustainability on this planet. This course will focus on some key approaches in psychology and how these can be applied to create a more sustainable society.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

Our planet is undergoing radical environmental and social changes. Environmental sustainability has now been put into question by, for example, our consumption patterns, loss of biodiversity, depletion of resources, and imbalanced power relations. With apparent ecological and social limits to globalization and development, the current levels of consumption are unsustainable, inequitable, and inaccessible to the majority of humans. Understanding the environmental sustainability is a crucial matter at a time when our planet is in peril - both environmentally and socially. This course will show possible pathways for a sustainable earth.

This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind -e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an 'identity'.Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.
