Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Market intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting both internal and external sources of marketing information so as to enable the company to better understand the market environment in which it competes, thus equipping managers with the timely knowledge to make well-informed marketing decisions in a dynamic environment. Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

The primary theme of the course is that service organizations require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy, both in its development and execution. A second theme of the course focuses on the role of service in manufacturing businesses. 

This course will suggest ways that firms in the manufactured goods sector might use 'service' as a primary source of competitive advantage. The design and delivery of services depends on the close coordination between marketing, operations management, information technology and human resources. As a result, an effective strategy to market services must be interdisciplinary in nature.
	
The seminars adopt an active-learning approach so that the student can discover, develop and transform knowledge which he/she can retain for further processing and reconstructionin the future. Activities consist of interactive lectures, discussions and presentations and out-of-classroom group projects. The primary aim of these activities is to help the student better understand the concepts, theories and tools learnt and relate themto the real world.

The brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically its most valuable assets. Product designs and manufacturing processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that cannot be easily reproduced. In recent years, many firms are realizing the importance of branding and are putting more resources in this area. People who have a good knowledge of brand management are in constant demand. In view of this trend, the purpose of this course is to equip students with the knowledge in the latest branding theories and techniques. 

The course will cover the broad theories on branding and also the more specific do?s and don?ts in the implementation. Significant amount of time will also be spent discussing actual branding success and failure stories to allow students better relate the theories to brands they are familiar with. Upon completion of the course, students will hopefully have a better idea of how to build and manage brands over time.

The course is designed to introduce students to tourism and hospitality as a human and commercial activity and planning and development issue which affects us all and has important economic, environmental, socio-cultural and political implications. A large and powerful industry is shown to be at work to meet the needs of the leisure and corporate markets, operating globally and characterised by multiple sectors. Subjects to be covered include the structure and organisation of the tourism and hospitality industry and critical challenges for managers. Attention is also given to the scale of tourist movements in the 21st century, tourism's impacts and the need for sustainable development. Emphasis is placed on topical events and issues, revealing the fast-changing nature of the tourism and hospitality business in terms of both demand and supply. Several of the illustrations used are from Singapore, but reference is made to wider regional and global conditions and trends. The course is intended to complement other second year specialisation core courses and acts as a foundation for final year studies.

At the end of the course, students will have an awareness of the complexity of the modern tourism and hospitality industry and an understanding of its dynamics. Insights will have been gained into the problems and opportunities faced by managers in the contemporary world and strategies adopted in response. Students also will be able to demonstrate their knowledge, think creatively and critically about tourism and hospitality management issues and communicate ideas in an effective manner.
