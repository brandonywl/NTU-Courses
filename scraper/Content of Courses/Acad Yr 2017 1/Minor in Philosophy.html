This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind -e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an 'identity'.Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of modern logic, as well as applications of logic to classic philosophical problems and paradoxes. Many age-old philosophical problems are deceptively simple but are in fact quite complicated, and we can easily get confused. The first step towards rational and independent thinking is to clear away such confusions. Symbolic logic is a powerful set of techniques that are used by modern philosophers to think clearly about these
problems. The core of the class will consist of a sequence where students are introduced first to modern propositional logic, and then to predicate (first order) logic, using a natural deduction style proof system. Along the way, we will discuss some classic paradoxes such as the liar paradox,
Zeno?s paradox, and Russell?s paradox, as well as applications of logic to philosophical problems such as the ontological argument for the existence of God. Students will acquire concepts and techniques for thinking clearly and independently about these problems, and will then be able to apply
them to a wide range of problems, not just in philosophy.

Morality has always been an important matter in human society, especially
in our multicultural age. What is the nature of morality? What makes an
action right or wrong? How do we think ethically? This course introduces
students to these and related issues. It covers major moral theories with
particular reference to the contemporary world.

This course introduces the thought of major figures in the Chinese philosophical tradition and examines primary texts (in English translation) in the schools of Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Buddhism. Drawing on ideas from these Chinese thinkers, the course also investigates the
treatment of fundamental issues in Chinese philosophy, such as virtue, freedom, reason, reality, knowledge, love, harmony, and the good life. These subjects are studied for both their historical and modern significance.

This course explores some fundamental problems in political philosophy. We will examine classic texts written by thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as influential works by contemporary philosophers. All these writings should be appreciated as offering very good answers to difficult moral questions about government, rights, justice, and citizenship. However, as the student will see, the authors often disagree with one another, and no single philosopher's view of things is beyond criticism. The student's task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned opinion as to how the problems of the course are best resolved.

What is the right thing to do? What is the fundamental nature of the universe? Are there limits to knowledge? These questions, which we continue to ask today, were also pondered and debated by philosophers over two thousand years ago, and in trying to answer them, they developed sophisticated systems of thought. This course aims to teach students the
views of the highly influential philosophers of ancient Greece, Rome, and other regions of the ancient world. The main philosophers covered will be Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and some of the Pre-Socratics. The course is structured around several topics, including ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

Public policy is any institution, norm, or rule created by a government to guide people?s behavior. The study of public policy raises significant ethical questions. In particular: to what ends should citizens? behavior be guided, and by which means should a government guide such behavior? When might a public policy intervention by the government in the affairs of private individuals be unethical? Ethics and Public Policy will survey a number of areas in which public policy has been used to address social and political issues: crime, immigration, health, safety, inequality, religion, and the family. Students will question, debate, and reflect on the ethical principles which favor or disfavor the implementation of various public policies.
