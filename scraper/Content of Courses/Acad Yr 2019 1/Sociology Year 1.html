This introductory course explores what it means to develop the 'sociological imagination'.  Moving beyond an understanding of the biological basis of behaviour, the course develops a perspective of the human person located in 'society' - within webs of social relationships and institutional forms of social organisation.  Social life is governed by norms and constraints, but individuals as social actors also 'make history' and exercise choice in their lives.  In addition, the course develops a comparative understanding of the diversity of societal forms and cultural traditions in human history, especially the key features of modern life and its continued transformation in contemporary times.

Beginning with a broad perspective on the historical formation of Singapore, from its premodern roots, through its evolution as a colonial society, and then its fast-paced development as a modern nation-state in Southeast Asia, this subject develops a holistic analysis of fundamental features of Singapore as a 'society'. The course examines the making of 'Singaporeans' and 'Singapore culture'. The patterns of social order and dynamics of social change are understood by focusing on the relationships between political rule, economic structure, and cultural life.

This course introduces students to sociological theories, methods, and research through an examination of selected social problems in a global context.  "Social problems" refers to sets of social conditions, arrangements, and practices whose resolution, or mere existence, social actors deem important. "Social problems" are social in two ways. First, social problems are constituted through human interaction. Second, social problems are socially defined and thus the meaning and significance of social problems may be contested. There are some social problems that pose practical (if different) challenges for us all. This course introduces sociological perspectives on social problems relating to poverty and inequality, work and occupations, social welfare, and the constitution and role of government.

This course examines the theoretical foundations of sociology as a discipline. It focuses on the key ideas and perspectives developed by classical social theorists in their analyses of basic features of social life, the making of modern society and the consequences of modernity. In particular, the contributions of major thinkers such as Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber are discussed against the backdrop of the social and intellectual contexts of their times. In understanding the pivotal influence of such contributions on the development of the discipline, the subject also considers their continuing relevance for analysing social change in the contemporary world.

Large -scale and complex organisations are a central feature of modern society. This course examines theories and types of organisations, especially in terms of hierarchy, control, authority, decision -making and accountability. In particular, it considers the rise and impact of bureaucracy and bureaucratic rationality in modern society and the subsequent development of schools or systems of management. In understanding the formal features of bureaucratic and post -bureaucratic organizations, the course also considers the informal, cultural and small -group processes that influence the functioning of organisations. Organisational change  and the transformation of management in contemporary society  is analysed in terms of the relations between organisations and their environments.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. You will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage you to critically evaluate  and  write about  issues  from  multiple  perspectives  before you develop your  own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as you go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus.
