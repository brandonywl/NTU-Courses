Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

This laboratory course is designed to help students effectively apply, interpret, and evaluate different multivariate statistical techniques. Conceptual understanding, including appropriate circumstances for use of each technique, the development of practical ?how-to? skills, and an understanding of the trade-offs made in technique choice will be emphasized. Students will gain hands-on experience through several project assignments throughout the semester. These assignments will require students to learn how to draw statistical and substantive conclusions from the results of their analyses. Students will prepare written summaries of results using APA or accepted writing guidelines that are common formats for journals in psychology. Topics covered in this course include factor analysis, MANOVA, logistic regression and discriminant analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, etc.

This applied module covers an introduction to the forensic psychology of crime, terrorism and disasters. This course will benefit those who have an interest in working in or with the police, prisons, civil defence, child custody areas, community forensic psychology as well as counselling, clinical and/or forensic settings. It will provide a ?realistic preview? of the work of a psychologist working in applied forensic contexts. Additionally, because working in forensic setting can be stressful, distressing and sometimes traumatic (e.g. dealing with bereaving families or dealing with potentially challenging clientele), this module also discusses employee assistance infrastructures such as counselling and peer counselling programs within police and law enforcement organizations. An applied psychologist working in police, fire or other law enforcement settings would need to appreciate how aspects of counselling psychology, criminological/legal psychology and organizational psychology all come together to address the real world problems faced in applied forensic settings.

The aim of this course is to outline how best available research is integrated with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preference to achieve evidence-based practice in clinical psychology. The course covers empirically supported treatments (cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic) for major problem areas (depression, personality disorders, neuropsychological impairment) and examines elements of effective therapy relationships (empathy, working alliance, collecting patient feedback) as well as effective methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient (reactance/resistance level, preferences, culture, religion and spirituality). This course aims to encourage a critical stance when considering the empirical status of treatment models and their clinical applications and provides hands-on experience in adopting elements of a therapeutic relationship.

This applied module aims to introduce you to the theories and practices of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (Occupational Psychology) as applied to individuals at work and to organisations. Students who have an interest in applying psychology to work settings will be exposed to a scope of topics that are relevant to the practice in both private and public sectors. 
 
The course aims to develop students? theoretical understanding as well as knowledge of the practical tools and solutions that are applied in the IO practice. The contextual learning is to help students understand the consulting cycle and stakeholder engagements unique to the IO practice. The intention is to provide the students a fairly comprehensive primer to what they may expect in further education and a career in the IO specialisation. 
 
The course will have a strong emphasis on applied skills. Each seminar will be structured such that students are exposed less to the theories of I/O Psychology and more to how they are practiced within organisations. This will include exposure to best guidelines as set by standard-setting bodies, commercial products and solutions commonly used in industry, and case studies to discuss the ethics of psychological societies of different nations.

Course content will especially focus on psychological and behavioral manifestations of problematic intergroup relations, such as stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. While prejudice and discrimination are typically associated with groups defined based on race and ethnicity, this course will also explore the psychology of intergroup relations in other domains, such as gender, age, teams, organizations, disability/illness, and stigmatized traits. In addition to offering lectures, readings, and presentations of empirical papers on the psychology of intergroup relations, students will also be encouraged to develop their own research questions through class discussion and writing assignments. The final project of the course will involve the application of knowledge gained through course activities to the preparation of the students' own research proposals.

Recent discoveries have overturned longstanding beliefs that the neurophysiology of the brain remains relatively fixed after childhood.  We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity.  For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs.

The study of death and dying is concerned with questions that are rooted at the core of human experience. Individuals who set out to increase their knowledge of mortality are embarking on life's most important exploration, a journey of personal discovery and spiritual awakening. Whilst acknowledging the finite nature of existence allows individuals to reflect upon the meaning of life to attend greater personhood, mortality also plays a pivotal role in defining cultural beliefs, family values and social structures. 

This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of the major psycho-socio-cultural perspectives, theories and clinical practices on death and dying from a global viewpoint with a critical focus on the Asian experience. Through interactive lectures, experiential workshops and creative group projects, students will be offered an opportunity to examine the psychological, socio-spiritual, ethical and political issues of mortality through a range of cultural lenses. Such exploration will facilitate insights, reflections and personal growth for enhancing students' capacity in dealing with the inevitability of morality, while equipping them with the core intellectual skills and values for living a meaningful and purposeful life.
