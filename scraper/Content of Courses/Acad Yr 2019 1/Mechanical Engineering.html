The objective is for you to undertake a sizeable project which will challenge you to utilize your knowledge in different areas of engineering to analyze, design and construct a predetermined product within a specified timeframe. You will learn to identify your own problems and seek your own solutions to execute the project, beyond the prescription of lectures and text books.

The course involves you, either singly or in a team, to execute a project, which may be pre-defined or self-proposed. Each project team will be assigned one or two mentors, who are NTU professors or practising engineers. They will also act as the assessors.

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem solving process with the aid of computer; i.e. formulating a problem and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as algorithms running on computer. As such, CT is essential not only to the Computer Science discipline, but also can be used to support problem solving across all disciplines, including math, science, engineering, business, finance and humanities. 

The aim of this course is hence to take you students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. You will also learn current computer languages, such as Python, for the coding. In addition, the course will include topics on the internal operations of a processor, and raise awareness on the socio-ethical issues arising from the pervasiveness of computing technology.

The purpose of a mechanism is to transmit motion and force. This course introduces the students some basic mechanisms including linkages, cams and gears. Mechanisms are the building blocks of a machine. In a machine design problem, very often the first task is to determine the type and configurations of mechanisms to provide the desired motions. Once the kinematic issues are addressed, the dynamic analysis can then be performed. In this course, techniques for the kinematic and dynamic analyses of mechanisms will be covered. A course in the theory of mechanisms is essential for any mechanical engineers as the knowledge is fundamental in understanding the working of machines. Apart from analytical ability, it also provides students the opportunities to develop their design capability.

This course introduces the basic theory of electrical linear networks as well as the application of basic electronic devices. Students are first provided with the analytical tools to solve linear resistive networks and to derive linear equivalent networks. These formal methods are then generalized to include reactive components, such as capacitors and inductors, analyzing the network behaviors both in frequency (AC steady state analysis) and in time (transient analysis).
The second part of the course will introduce the basic electronics components such as operational amplifiers, diodes and transistors, with special emphasis on the practical use and applications. Students will use operational amplifiers to design simple linear filters. Diodes and transistors will be used in nonlinear applications such as rectifiers and digital logic.

This course is organized into two closely related modules. 
Module 1 introduces what is Systems Thinking and how does it relate to Systems Engineering.  Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties.  Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management.

Module 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system.  The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance.  

This course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems.  

A special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing.
