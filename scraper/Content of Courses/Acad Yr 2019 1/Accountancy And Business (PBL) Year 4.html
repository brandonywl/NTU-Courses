Many companies engage in cross-border business and they face important financial questions beyond those found in a purely domestic setting.  This course aims at providing the necessary understanding and tools to evaluate, finance, and manage international business.   The issues and tools discuss are particularly relevant in the context of a country like Singapore which is a small and highly open economy.  All Singapore companies have to somehow engage in international business.

The course will first explain the global financial markets that facilitate international business and explain the key economic linkages among them.  In the context of international finance, understanding foreign exchange rates is crucial. Therefore, this course will also explain exchange rates and those factors that affect the rates. We then examine the challenges for companies created by unexpected changes in exchange rates. We also discuss how, if at all, these firms should manage their exposure to currency fluctuations. 

Next, we explore the traditional areas of corporate finance including capital budgeting, cost of capital and financial structure from the perspective of multinational companies. 

The recent financial crisis and other contemporary global financial issues will also be explored.

Financial derivatives have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past two decades.
However, there remain disagreements about the merits of derivatives. For example, Alan
Greenspan, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, believes that derivatives
increase financial stability; whereas Warren Buffet, the famed investor, asserts that
derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.

This course helps students to gain better understandings of derivatives and introduces
students to the usages and valuations of derivatives such as options, forward and futures
contracts.

The objective of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive coverage of the principles and techniques in equity securities analysis, especially asset valuation. Valuation is at the heart of every investment decision, whether that decision is to buy, sell, or hold. Due to the globalization process and ever-changing dynamics of the modern financial markets, the pricing of any financial asset has become a more complex task. This course will guide you through the theory and application of valuation models and highlights their strengths and weaknesses.  It will cover valuation of unconventional assets, financial service firms, start-ups, private companies, dot-coms, and many other traditionally valued assets.

This course explicitly applies finance theories to solve various problems in financial management and investments. Microsoft Excel is a primary tool for implementation. The course enables students to perform financial analysis and to make financial decisions through financial models created with the use of Excel. Students will have ample opportunities to practice numerical analyses and graphical illustrations that arise out of applications in finance such as forecasting financial statement, estimating costs of capital, constructing efficient portfolio, computing covariance matrix, measuring value at risk, pricing options & real options, and fixed-income analytics. Though the course extensively uses Excel, its focus is still finance applications.
