"Services represent the fastest growing sector of any developed economy. In the United States, this sector is responsible for nearly 75% of GDP and 80% of employment. Similarly, 75% of GDP and 70% of jobs in Singapore are generated by services. This trend persists in other industrialized nations. Moreover, these figures under-represent the actual role and significance of services in the economy because many manufacturing firms are increasingly involved in service-type jobs such as design, distribution, financial planning, customization, and after-sales services. That said, it is important for any manager (or student of management) to understand how services differ from manufacturing operations, and how toefficiently and effectively manage service operations.

In the first 7 weeks of the course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for designing, managing, analyzing, and improving service operations. Students will also learn to use analytical models and decision support tools for improving the operational effectiveness and efficiency in service organizations. Topics covered include Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Quality, Process Management, Project Management, Forecasting, Queue Management, Workforce Scheduling, and Capacity & Demand Management. 

The remaining weeks will focus on understanding the basics of service operations in the hospitality industry. Specific topics such as Front Office Management, F&B Management, Housekeeping, Facility Maintenance, and Revenue Management will be covered in this segment.

The goals of the course are:
1.   to provide an understanding and appreciation of the service functions of firms related to the
      Hospitality and Tourism industry,
2.   to understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to succeed in
      designing and managing service operations. The teaching method used is seminar style
      with a mix of lectures, in-class problem solving, discussions, video showing, and facility
      tours."
