2.	gain an understanding of the methodologies, tools and techniques necessary for analyzing, implementing, managing and continuously improving lean operations in both manufacturing and service industries. 

3.	develop an appreciation of applications of Toyota Production System, Value Stream Mapping, Pull Systems, Lean thinking in banking and healthcare operations. 

4.	use simulation for modeling and analyzing real life systems

5.	communicate ideas/ insights of business/operations analytics solutions


Content

Topics covered in the course include Toyota Production System, Lean Principles, Value Stream Mapping, Pull Systems, Lean thinking in banking and healthcare operations, and use of simulation for modeling and analyzing real life systems.

Business Analytics Consulting is a career option that provides incumbents an opportunity for challenging work, continued self-development, access to important social and professional networks, and, over time, significant financial rewards. The consulting profession offers work opportunities in large global organizations that practice in a variety of business settings and business disciplines, and in small firms offering niche/boutique services. In addition many businesses have developed internal consulting organizations to provide consulting related services within the organization and often in conjunction with consulting services offered by third party firms.

This is an applications course exposing participants to the profession of business analytics consulting. The course is designed to develop an appreciation of the art and science of providing recommendations to client organizations/departments.

"Services represent the fastest growing sector of any developed economy. In the United States, this sector is responsible for nearly 75% of GDP and 80% of employment. Similarly, 75% of GDP and 70% of jobs in Singapore are generated by services. This trend persists in other industrialized nations. Moreover, these figures under-represent the actual role and significance of services in the economy because many manufacturing firms are increasingly involved in service-type jobs such as design, distribution, financial planning, customization, and after-sales services. That said, it is important for any manager (or student of management) to understand how services differ from manufacturing operations, and how toefficiently and effectively manage service operations.

In the first 7 weeks of the course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for designing, managing, analyzing, and improving service operations. Students will also learn to use analytical models and decision support tools for improving the operational effectiveness and efficiency in service organizations. Topics covered include Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Quality, Process Management, Project Management, Forecasting, Queue Management, Workforce Scheduling, and Capacity & Demand Management. 

The remaining weeks will focus on understanding the basics of service operations in the hospitality industry. Specific topics such as Front Office Management, F&B Management, Housekeeping, Facility Maintenance, and Revenue Management will be covered in this segment.

The goals of the course are:
1.   to provide an understanding and appreciation of the service functions of firms related to the
      Hospitality and Tourism industry,
2.   to understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to succeed in
      designing and managing service operations. The teaching method used is seminar style
      with a mix of lectures, in-class problem solving, discussions, video showing, and facility
      tours."

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are a large-scale network of computing systems characterized by their interaction with the physical world (sensors and actuators). CPS are the driving force behind modern civilization, being an integral part of technologies such as avionics including drones, autonomous vehicles, etc. These systems generally have hard real-time constraints that require the cyber components to process physical inputs and generate appropriate physical outputs within pre-defined temporal requirements. For example, think about obstacle detection and avoidance in autonomous vehicles. Such systems, also called time-critical computing systems, are the primary focus of this course.
In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). RTOS is the core software platform used in time-critical computing, just like an OS in a general-purpose computing system. You will learn RTOS techniques for processor scheduling, process synchronization, etc. You will also learn how such time-critical computing platforms are networked together using protocols that support real-time communication. Building on this foundation, you will also learn how to implement a time-critical system using a drone-based platform.

The internet has become a convenient platform for commercial transactions executed by application systems. Commercial transactions are obvious targets for criminal activities. Securing such transactions involves multiple parties, hardware components, and protocols which are important to the security of the underlying application systems. Practitioners in this field need to be familiar with current security technologies but also appreciate the respective management tasks and responsibilities of the parties involved.
