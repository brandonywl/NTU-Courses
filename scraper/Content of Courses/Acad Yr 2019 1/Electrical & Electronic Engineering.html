The basic goal of this course is to give you a fundamental understanding of astronomy. Through the course, you will learn about the birth and evolution of the universe, the origin of galaxies, the evolution of stars and the formation of planets. Our solar system will also be one of the main topics to be studied. Important cosmology topics will be presented, some unanswered mysteries of the universe and mankind will be discussed and hopefully arise further interest and lead you to further your own exploration. During this course, the diverse facts that form the context of a science will be delivered, and as a result you will understand our place in the Universe. During the course, you will also have opportunities to participate in various practical sessions: a few evening stargazing session are organized during the semester -when appropriate- in order to facilitate direct observation of suitable astronomical objects (Moon, planets, star clusters).

This course covers the fundamental process of innovation through its implications on organizations and innovation ecosystems. It emphasizes historical and modern examples of innovation in materials and devices, and discusses the final implications for innovation ecosystems.  This course also presents a simple model for students to understand the innovation process as a highly iterative process, in which many factors in the areas of Technology, Market and Implementation are cycled repeatedly through until the right pieces come together.

This course will be conducted online and will spread over 13 weeks. On top of online lectures, there will also be online assignments which will be graded. In addition, there will be a group project which involves online research and applying concepts learnt in the course. The team will then need to present their project ideas to the course instructors at the end of the course. Students selecting this course will need to have face-to-face meetings with their team-members and the course instructors.
