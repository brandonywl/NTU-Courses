This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

Traditionally linguistic analysis was done largely by hand, but computer-based methods and tools are becoming increasingly more widely used in contemporary research. This course provides an introduction to the key instruments and resources available on the personal computer that can assist the linguist in performing fast, flexible and accurate quantitative analyses. Students will learn a scripting language (Python) and use it and the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) to analyse linguistic phenomena. The following topics will be covered in detail:
	File input/output
	Control Structures
	Frequency Distributions
	Regular Expressions
	Access to lexical resources
	Classification

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

Students will be introduced to the process of scientific inquiry in psychology, both in terms of empirical research methodology and statistical analysis. The course is divided into lectures and tutorials. The lectures will focus on conceptual issues and cover the content materials that students need to understand to actually design any psychological study and work with any data. The tutorials will be dedicated to more in-depth discussions of some of the topics covered in the lectures, and practical experience with data analysis using SPSS

This course will provide an introductory overview to the field of biological psychology.  Course content will begin by explaining what biological psychology is and why biology is the ultimate basis for the expression of behavior in any living organism. The course will cover the anatomy of the nervous system by exploring the structures of the brain, spine and neurons, and will introduce the basic techniques used by biopsychologists. In addition, the biological foundations of the perceptual and sensorimotor systems will be covered.  The course will also cover the plasticity of the brain and how damage to the brain can influence behavior. We will cover material on the biological basis of motivation, cognition and emotion. We will study how hormones influence behavior, and we will cover the biology of sleep. Lastly, the course will introduce pharmacology, and the neurology of stress and psychological disorders.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. You will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage you to critically evaluate  and  write about  issues  from  multiple  perspectives  before you develop your  own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as you go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus.

HY0001 will introduce students to three major ethical theories' utilitarianism, Kant's deontology, and virtue ethics. Then, four weeks will be devoted to teaching the ethical principles underlying academic integrity, research ethics, and intellectual property. Finally, students will discuss issues related to the ethics of environmental sustainability and conservation. All the while, students will be challenged apply the ethical theories learned to concrete moral problems, including world poverty, corporate accountability and whistleblowing, and workplace discrimination.
