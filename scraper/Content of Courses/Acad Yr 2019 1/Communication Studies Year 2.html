This course introduces the core components of motion picture production: idea, image, sound, and sequence.  In lecture, students will view movies and/or television programmes while considering a variety of questions.  What do we want to express?  Who is our audience?  How do we talk about images?  What compositional elements can we control or manipulate? How do we sequence images in order to evoke specific responses?  What happens when particular sounds and images are juxtaposed?  In related tutorials, students will explore these concepts with digital video cameras and nonlinear editing.

In Korean Cinema in the Global Context you will explore the history and theory of Korean cinema
- both South and North through the framework of national/transnational cinema discourse, auteur/genre theory, globalization, the North/South division system, and the problem of nation/state which evokes the question of identity. In this chronologically structured module, you will learn the cinema of Korea through a set of key films, directors, and dominant genres by lectures, screenings, and intensive and engaging discussions throughout the semester. Such critically and historically important films as The Aimless Bullet, The Housemaid, Shiri, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, My Sassy Girl, The Host, and Train to Busan will be screened. Through readings, discussions, in-class screenings, and presentations, our goal is to develop a broad understanding of Korean cinema and popular cultures exploring their wide-ranging impact and asking how they participate in the transnational production and circulation of culture, ideology, modernity, politics, and tradition in both regional and international contexts. It is not necessary for student to have prior knowledge of Korean cinema, and all are welcome.

To better understand how and why communication occurs and what effects it has, it is necessary to get inside the "black box" of the human mind. Therefore, this course will concentrate on studying cognitive processes and their relationship to media and communication. While some attention will be paid to the psychological aspects of interpersonal communication, the primary the goal of the course is to develop an understanding of media from a psychological perspective. That is, the course will examine how perception, attention, memory, attitudes and emotion are related to the experience of mediated communication. These psychological responses will be examined in a range of contexts and communication functions including news and information, advertising and persuasion, and entertainment. This will help students become both better producers of media and more critical users.

The course is about the different forces at work in a magazine. It will give students an understanding of magazine writing, projection, editing, production and distribution; the skills to take up an entry-level job in an editorial department; insights into the industry and the wide variety of titles; and will show them the creative process involved. It will take them from the initial conceptualisation of a title, through the business side of generating income, to the creative hothouse that produces lively, inventive, relevant publications on a regular basis. 
It will put magazines in a social and cultural perspective, both in Singapore and overseas, and invite students to consider potential new titles.

The course introduces students to the quantitative aspects of media planning. Topics covered will include brand analysis, audience analysis, market segmentation, and media analysis. Case studies and real-life practices will be included in this class. During the first half of the semester, students will conduct a brand audit and develop and administer a survey to determine target audience media usage. The information from the brand audit and market survey will then be used to compile a strategic media plan. Strategies and recommendations will form the basis of the media plan.  
 
The course will be taught in an active learning fashion. It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building. All students are expected to be active and proactive in course activities.

The focus of this course is on the creation, production, performance, and dissemination of various forms of publicity to support a range of comprehensive communication campaigns. It covers print and audiovisual media and the activities of government and non-profit organisations as well as private corporations.  The course is organised around a client project.  The proposed campaign will require that students to do some basic consumer research, develop a positioning strategy, create original advertising and other marketing communication materials, develop a media plan, and put all of these elements into a written plan and presentation for the client as if they were "pitching" for an account.

This course will introduce the theoretical foundation of cutting-edge data analytic techniques and its applications to communication research, focusing on Bayesian statistics. Its theoretical part will cover the philosophical discourses over empirical research, basic probability theory, the logic of hypothesis testing, and statistical inference and learning from data. Two special topics include the applications of Bayesian statistics to machine learning techniques. An equal weight of emphasis will be placed on developing practical skills for collecting and analysing data to solve real-world problems. Students will learn computational programming languages, such as R and Python, through a series of tutorials, lab assignments, and final projects. The well-balanced combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills offered in this course will provide qualification requirements both for professional analysts in media industry and for academic researchers in communication studies and other social sciences.

This course introduces students to the different genres of contemporary popular global cinemas. In addition to Hollywood feature films, students will study non-Hollywood contemporary films that have proven successfully at the box offices either internationally and/or in their countries of production in order to study the critical elements that have contributed to the success of these films. Students will be exposed to box office hits from a wide variety of countries such as Spain, the UK, Japan, Korea, India and Australia. The analysis of these popular films will be contextualised in relation to relevant film theories such as genre theory, audience reception theories, studies of the economic development of new cinematic industries and the impact of global film distribution.

A network is a collection of nodes that are connected in pairs by edges, which is the most powerful way of representing complex and dynamic systems like human societies. People, artifacts, events, and anything else around us can be viewed as nodes, and their interactions as edges. Friendship, love, ideas, information, money, power, or even disease pass through and are shaped by networks, and therefore, can be formulated and examined from a network perspective. This course will introduce the core concepts of network analysis and their applications to real- world problems. Its theoretical part will cover the fundamental theory of network analysis and review related works on social and communication networks. An equal weight of emphasis will be placed on developing practical skills for collecting and analyzing data to investigate empirical networks using computational programming languages, such as R and Python.

In the years following its emergence in the 1890s, motion picture quickly became an enormously popular art form, as well as a large and lucrative industry. Focusing on the American and  European context, Global Film Cultures: Hollywood and the West will examine the relationship between the artistic and industrial sides of the film, as well its cultural impact and the implications of its status as a ?mass? art.
