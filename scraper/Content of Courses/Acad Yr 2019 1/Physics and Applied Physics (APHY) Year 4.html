In today's competitive world, it is essential that students learn the crucial career skills early to ensure a competitive edge sharpened with a heightened sense of workplace values and ethics.  This course takes students through a journey of career discovery, understanding and polishing of oneself which will then be translated into job application tools such as resumes and interview skills. 

All students will have the opportunity to undergo a robust Career Assessment Tool, which assesses their career options and career self and helps them chart a career action plan. They will also learn how to identify and articulate the concept of personal branding and applying that to resumes and interviews and online social media. Students will also be exposed to the basics of grooming to ensure that they are aware of the importance of first impressions in all situations.

This course covers three types of macroscopic quantum phenomena: superconductivity, superfluidity and atomic Bose-Einstein   condensates (BEC). We start with superfluid helium-4 and introduce macroscopic wave function, momentum distribution, flow quantization, rotating superfluid and vortices, quasi-particle excitations (phonons and rotons), and the two-fluid model by Tisza and Landau.

This course is a survey of particle physics for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. It explores the common roots and tools of the nuclear (medium energy) and particle (high energy) fields. The main objective is to develop an understanding of the Standard Model of quarks, leptons and the fundamental interactions of the universe together with the associated experimental techniques.
Specific topics include an introduction to the fundamental interactions and their mediators, quarks and leptons, symmetries and tests of conservation laws, and indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. The course in particular includes experimental techniques in particle physics, including the physics principles of particle accelerators and particle detectors. The lectures on particle accelerators will include selected topics in the types of accelerators, transverse & longitudinal dynamics, the lattice, magnets, RF and plasma acceleration, as well as electron dynamics & synchrotron radiation. The particle detector lectures will include a presentation of the main properties of particle interactions with matter, which form the basis of all particle detectors. The various types of detectors used in particle physics experiments are discussed in detail, including their sensitivity, detector response, energy, space and time resolution response functions, detector efficiency and dead time, covering devices for position and momentum measurements, particle identification systems, calorimeters and multipurpose systems, as well as the overall design of a particle physics experiment. Current and future experimental challenges will be discussed for modern particle physics experiments, including the data volume and computing challenge, the online collision selection, and the data analyses - taking the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at CERN as an example.  . 
The application of such accelerators and detectors, for example in the medical and industrial sectors, will be discussed as well.

The course introduces the fundamentals physical principles of acoustics and focuses on hearing and ultrasonic sound propagation in fluids; plane wave and sonar equations, sound speed dependencies and propagation modelling will be discussed. 
Different types of acoustic systems and the role of acoustic systems in underwater environments will be considered. As ultrasound is widely used in medical applications this course will focus on medical ultrasonic applications for diagnosis and for treatments purpose.

This course is portioned into fundamental acoustics, wave equations, sound propagation and sound modelling. The specific arrangement is:
1.	Introduction to physical acoustics, wave equations, reflection, equivalent network, piston and Rayleigh integral.
2.	Solutions to wave equations, sound speed profiles, 2D parabolic wave equation, underwater acoustic modelling, and sound propagation in the ocean. 
3.	Sonar wave equation, reflections, scattering and backscattering. Introduction to sonar systems and application in target detection and ranging.
4.	Bioacoustics: 
a)	Sound generation and sound perception in human beings: from vocal cords to frequency resolution of the cochlea. 
b)	Application of sound propagation, transmission losses, sound exposure levels and impact on the marine environment.
5.	Medical Ultrasound: introduction to diagnostic ultrasound, sound emission from bubbles, and therapeutical ultrasound.
