This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in Art History and Theory. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their relevance to Art History and Theory in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire key critical skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and new insights.
Finally, you will present your responses, in the form of a written paper and oral presentations.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the questions and issues it provokes. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Paper.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

This course explores European visual culture created in response to contact and interaction with non-Western cultures from the fifteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Various European representations of the exotic Orient (Near and Far East) will be examined. The influence of European Imperialism upon the fine arts will be analysed in relation to eighteenth-century colonial landscape painting, the Romantic Orientalism of Eugene Delacroix, the work of Jean-Auguste Dominque Ingres and Jean-Leon Gerome, the popularization of the East in terms of Chinoiserie and Japonisme, primitivism in the work of Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso, and the odalisques of Matisse. The course will also look at the rise of ethnography and the ethnographic museum, and the role of photography and international exhibitions.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This course is designed for students who?ve already taken foundational Art History courses and chronologically follows DD3005 Survey of Modern Art 1900-1945. In this course you will be introduced to the moment of transformation from modern to contemporary art. It?s intended as a historical and conceptual framework for the development of critical thinking and visual analysis regarding today?s art practice. You will be introduced to a series of art forms and ideas, which still pervade the contemporary, 21st century global art world. You will examine the cultural and socio- political contexts through which these art forms and ways of thinking emerged. The analysis of these artistic contexts is essential for the understanding of a number of parallel situations in contemporary Southeast Asian art and will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on the contemporary.

This introductory course covers key movements and events in the evolution of Interaction Design, Product Design and Visual Communication. In Interaction Design, you will survey the work and ideas of artists and designers who have explored interactive media, as well as the scientists, engineers and mathematicians who have developed information technologies. You will study the histories of certain technologies which have come to define the medium of personal computer and human-computer interaction. For Product Design, you will explore how design trends and movements are formed in the contexts of history, emphasizing human relationships between designed objects, visual imageries, art & design movements, science, technology, culture and society. In Visual Communication, you will gain a historical awareness of graphic design and its relationship to technology and industry practice. You will analyse design and designers from various eras through practice and theoretical research projects. This course will equip you with a solid foundation in design history and theory, and inform further study in contemporary design practice.

This course is foundational for more advanced art historical studies. It seeks to initiate critical reflection on 'art' and 'art history' as variable constructs subject to shifting matrixes of interconnected factors and forces. Based on a range of visual and textual materials from the pre-modern to the contemporary, the East and the West, the 'North' and the 'South', this course investigates the ways of seeing, representing, interpreting and thinking about 'art' and 'art history'. The first part of the course examines pictorial strategies adopted by image-makers from different periods and parts of the world; the second part explores a selection of art historical theories from Europe, East and South Asia. This learning will provide a conceptual framework for further, in-depth studies in global Art History.

This course is designed to situate art and artists in a number of diverse spiritual, geographical and historical contexts and in so doing allow you to explore art history through a variety of human beliefs. This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings? to our eyes; analyze what Jocho?s Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

This course is intended to deepen and widen your pre-existing knowledge of Asian or Buddhist art, and to develop critical frameworks for rethinking prevailing canons of Buddhist art. It covers a selection of artefacts, sites and works of art from over two millennia from ca. 300BCE to the 21st century. The geographical scope mirrors the internationalisation of Buddhism, from South Asia to East, Southeast Asia, and the Western world, since the first millennium. We ask: how have Buddhist teachings been interpreted by image-makers over space and time, and how have the representations been subsequently experienced, read and used, and what makes 'Buddhist art' 'Buddhist' and 'art'? These studies will provide a basis for further in-depth studies of Buddhist Art.

This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

contextualised in terms of its contribution to a wider historical and theoretical debate.
Approaches covered will include Marxist history, the Annales School, Historical
Sociology, the history of Nationalism, Micro-history, The Cultural Turn, Gender history,
Subaltern Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, the history of the Senses, and Oral history.
