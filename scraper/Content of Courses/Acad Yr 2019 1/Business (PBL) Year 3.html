The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

The social context of the workplace is changing rapidly.  These changes place new demands on leaders to influence people effectively to achieve the desired outcomes.  The course aims to provide final year undergraduate students with an appreciation of the new demands of leadership in the workplace. Using a mix of lectures and workshops supplemented with leadership assessments and coaching assignments, students will gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the effectiveness of leadership in organisations.  The course will also provide students with a greater self-awareness of themselves as leaders - their motivation to lead, their values and  personality, and their leadership-related beliefs.  The course will also provide students with an opportunity to clarify their philosophy of leadership in order to prepare them for leadership roles in the future work environment.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

In a rapidly changing, dynamic, uncertain and engaging world, which quite quickly renders various products and services obsolete or irrelevant and new opportunities and challenges arise, organizations need to continuously innovate and come out with new solutions.  This is all the more pertinent and urgently needed in an increasingly connected world, where rapid technological innovations continue to proliferate our world and the digital revolution is fast impacting values demanded by customers, offerings by competitors and the way businesses are carried out and product/services are marketed.  

The aim of this course is to enable students to learn practical skills and intellectual knowledge of how to market innovations, for sustainable success. 

This subject complements the suite of existing marketing and other business subjects that are offered by NBS. It provides yet another avenue for students interested to pursue their career with organisations engaged in innovations or who may wish to have their own start-ups.

This is a second year course for undergraduate business students specializing in banking and finance. It is mandatory for all banking and finance students except ACBS students specializing in banking and finance. It is optional for non-finance business students.

The course aims to provide participants with an understanding of the use of financial statement information from a user perspective such as equity investor, debt holder, financial analyst and manager. The course examines the impact of different accounting choices on reported earnings, shareholders' equity, cash flow and various measures of corporate performance.  Participants will develop skills in analysing financial statements for investment, credit and other business decisions. In view of the considerable similarities among US Financial Reporting Standards (US GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (FRS) for most of the topics covered in this course, we will focus on FRS in this course. Main differences between FRS and IFRS (and/or US GAAP) will be highlighted where appropriate.

Many companies engage in cross-border business and they face important financial questions beyond those found in a purely domestic setting.  This course aims at providing the necessary understanding and tools to evaluate, finance, and manage international business.   The issues and tools discuss are particularly relevant in the context of a country like Singapore which is a small and highly open economy.  All Singapore companies have to somehow engage in international business.

The course will first explain the global financial markets that facilitate international business and explain the key economic linkages among them.  In the context of international finance, understanding foreign exchange rates is crucial. Therefore, this course will also explain exchange rates and those factors that affect the rates. We then examine the challenges for companies created by unexpected changes in exchange rates. We also discuss how, if at all, these firms should manage their exposure to currency fluctuations. 

Next, we explore the traditional areas of corporate finance including capital budgeting, cost of capital and financial structure from the perspective of multinational companies. 

The recent financial crisis and other contemporary global financial issues will also be explored.

Financial derivatives have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past two decades.
However, there remain disagreements about the merits of derivatives. For example, Alan
Greenspan, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, believes that derivatives
increase financial stability; whereas Warren Buffet, the famed investor, asserts that
derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.

This course helps students to gain better understandings of derivatives and introduces
students to the usages and valuations of derivatives such as options, forward and futures
contracts.

The objective of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive coverage of the principles and techniques in equity securities analysis, especially asset valuation. Valuation is at the heart of every investment decision, whether that decision is to buy, sell, or hold. Due to the globalization process and ever-changing dynamics of the modern financial markets, the pricing of any financial asset has become a more complex task. This course will guide you through the theory and application of valuation models and highlights their strengths and weaknesses.  It will cover valuation of unconventional assets, financial service firms, start-ups, private companies, dot-coms, and many other traditionally valued assets.

This course explicitly applies finance theories to solve various problems in financial management and investments. Microsoft Excel is a primary tool for implementation. The course enables students to perform financial analysis and to make financial decisions through financial models created with the use of Excel. Students will have ample opportunities to practice numerical analyses and graphical illustrations that arise out of applications in finance such as forecasting financial statement, estimating costs of capital, constructing efficient portfolio, computing covariance matrix, measuring value at risk, pricing options & real options, and fixed-income analytics. Though the course extensively uses Excel, its focus is still finance applications.

Effective negotiation skills are important and necessary in one's personal as well as professional life.  This course aims to increase awareness of the negotiation process, to equip the participant with a basic framework with which to analyse and prepare for negotiations, and to help participants develop a more effective negotiating style.  This course also aims to introduce students to the concept of mediation, which is essentially negotiation with the aid of a neutral third party who is skilled in negotiation techniques.

This course adopts a variety of teaching methods.  There will be lectures and discussions, video-screenings of negotiation skills and actual negotiations, experiential learning through role-playing and simulation exercises, written self-review as well as peer and instructor review.  Negotiation exercises are drawn from a variety of contexts - personal and legal, bilateral and multilateral.  The course will also include a field trip to the Singapore Mediation Centre.

Important Note: 
To get the most out of the course, it is important that participants are well-prepared for class and actually attend the class.  Your lack of preparedness, or absence from class will severely compromise your personal learning experience as well as the experience of the rest of the class and will be viewed very seriously in assessing your final grade. You are required to attend every seminar. You should therefore consider your commitment to the course carefully before signing up. 

As the course uses Harvard Law School materials for the simulation exercises, the cost of acquiring these will be borne by participants. The amount varies depending on the actual exercises used, but it should be about $50 per person. The instructors will provide more details when the course begins.
