This studio course provides an introduction to the techniques and processes of recording production sound with a focus on dialog for fiction and documentary film. The physics of sound and hearing will be examined in the context of the aesthetics of sound for images. Microphone types, functions and best practices for their use will be examined. Single and dual system audio recording techniques will be demonstrated. Students will learn how to prepare production audio for postproduction editing. An introduction to post production will include transfer formats from NLEs to Pro Tools and an introduction to dialog editing. This learning will form the basis for students to refine their use of sound in future media projects.

What is Sound?
Overview of the physics of sound and psychoacoustics. How we hear; frequency, amplitude, pitched and non-pitched sounds. Noise and types of noise. Listening to sound and developing a vocabulary to discuss it critically.

Microphones:
An investigation into the properties and operating principles of modern microphones. What the various types of microphone are and how we chose the best one for a particular application. Inverse square law, phase cancellation and proximity effect as related to the use of microphones.

Production Sound Recording:
Single and Dual system recording is explored in the context of recording dialog for fiction and non-fiction films. Location mixers, recorders, laviller and shotgun microphones will be examined and utilised in practical exercises. Correct protocols and techniques for on set dialog recording will investigated with a consideration of the aesthetics of dialog recording. Critical listening to identify and correct sound recording errors will be developed.

Post Production:
Delivering production sound to the editor including correct sound coverage and a complete sound report will be explored. Synchronising sound and image in picture editing software and exporting  sound and image from this software using the correct output formats. Basics of editing sound in audio editing software with an emphasis on understanding how production recording influences post production sound editing. Post production processing techniques including noise reduction, compression and EQ will be introduced and examined.

Class assignments:
There are four in class dialog recording assignments that explore various shooting scenarios and recording systems. The final 2 assignments include a dialogue editing component. There will also be 2 in class quizzes covering more theoretical aspects of sound, sound recording and post production.

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.
