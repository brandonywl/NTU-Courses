Computational thinking (CT) is a problem solving process with the aid of computer; i.e. formulating a problem and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as algorithms running on computer. As such, computational thinking is essential not only to the Computer Science discipline, it can also be used to support problem solving across all disciplines, including math, science, engineering, business, finance and humanities.

The aim of this course is hence to take students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the programs to solve some basic problems in chemical engineering domain.

`Communicating as a 21st Century Engineer' aims to help students in the Renaissance Engineering Programme to become highly skilled communicators. You will explore in depth how to use language appropriately and effectively, in varied academic and professional contexts, to achieve desired purposes with different audiences. While the course focuses on how to write and present dynamic technical proposals and reports, you will learn important general principles that you can apply to other forms of written and spoken communication. An important aspect of the course is that you will learn how to learn about effective communication on your own. This will involve you learning how to read, analyse and respond critically to a range of texts from engineering and other disciplines.  The course also covers non-verbal aspects of communication, such as the use of graphics, as well as ethical dimensions of academic and professional communication.

This course is the first of two parts to an integrated engineering innovate-and-design curriculum which aims to introduce a systematic engineering design process to the students and provide a design project experience to develop their design skills.  The course therefore aims to provide students with an understanding of customer needs, product/design specifications, design concept generation, various design methodologies, aesthetics and industrial design, the application of computer-aided tools to the design/evaluation/manufacturing process of products/systems, and a systems approach to design.
