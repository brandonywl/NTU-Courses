This course aims to teach students about reporting in two related specialized fields - science and health. First, the course will give students an appreciation of science and medical journalism; from vaccines to viruses, satellites to space stations, embryonic stem cells to genomes, pollution and conservation, new and old diseases, potential pandemics, a growing pharmaceutical industry and an aging population. Next, the course will focus on strategies for communicating science and health to the public; how to explain things, how to interview experts who seem to speak a language of their own, how to research and write meaningful stories for a general audience.

This course offers a comparative study of issues related to the history of biology and the uses of biological knowledge in East Asia. Biomedical technologies, biosecurity, biodiversity, and biobanking number among various issues that increasingly pertain to biopolitics. Used to describe 17th century shifts in sovereign power, Foucault raised the term biopolitics, along with anatomo-politics, to describe how different levels of life became increasingly regulated, from species-centric populations to individual bodies, respectively. Issues that involve the biological occur in many different locations with different styles of governance, but analyses of biopolitics have tended to relate more to European history. Within the grain of Asian history, the study of issues that involve the biological requires a questioning of existing theoretical frameworks used to examine the politicization of life. This class explores imperial, colonial, and national experiences in East Asia in order to examine how various societies, polities, and people have authored, approached, and interpreted knowledge about different levels of regenerative life. HH1001 highly recommended in preparation of this course.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?
