This course aims to introduce the fundamentals of virus prophylaxis, therapeutics and diagnostics. You will learn to recognise how viruses differ from other microorganisms, recognise the relevance of emerging virus infection in a local and international context and recognise the clinical and economic importance of virus infections. You will be able to define some of the current focuses on virus research (in a global context). You will also be able to critically evaluate and discuss the reporting of virus disease by others e.g. in the media.

The aim of this course is to provide you with fundamental knowledge and develop your practical skills in molecular and cell biology methods and techniques. They are methods and techniques that are used to determine gene expression using reverse transcription-PCR, to manipulate gene expression using CRISPR/Cas9 systems or short hairpin RNAs, to culture and transfect mammalian cells, to analyse protein-protein interactions using immunoprecipation and GST-fusion protein pulldown assays, to determine protein localization in the cell using fluorescent labeling and fluorescence microscopy, to resolve and detect interacting proteins using gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, and to analyse protein-DNA interaction using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. You will learn how to operate essential laboratory equipment. You will develop skills for organizing and presenting experimental data in graphs, tables and gels. You will develop the skills for analyzing and interpreting experimental data. These basic research skills will prepare you for the BS4020 final year research project and potentially a career in a research laboratory.

The course will survey the genes and gene products which control cellular proliferation, and the genetic changes that lead to the various stages of cancer. You will apply this information by studying real or imagined experiments and proposing hypotheses to explain the results. You will think broadly about the molecular mechanisms regulating cell function and how these are assessed experimentally. You will apply your understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating cancer cells to understand how therapies can be developed to target cancer. Learning will be accomplished through a combination of traditional lectures, online learning and lab practicals.

This course aims to explore an evolutionary analysis of animal behavior. You will work in teams to unravel case studies in class and while completing assignments. You will analyse behavior from the vantage points of natural selection vis-a-vis alternative explanations. The course strives to bring into sharp relief the influence of evolution on biological processes and aims to foster critical examination of behavioral evidence with an equipoised interpretation of conflicting views. In the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky,"Nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution."

This 13-week programme provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in the development and regulation of healthcare products. The main area of concentration is in medical devices and is divided into four parts. The course begins with a historical introduction into the healthcare products industry and the start of regulatory controls. It then moves into the core principles of healthcare products regulations and expands into the methodologies of ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes going through the fundamentals of Good Manufacturing Practices, quality management systems, product risk classification, risk management and the different regulatory systems in the world. At the end of this course, you should have a clear understanding of healthcare products regulations and able to apply these requirements in product development. You will also be required to perform casework to test their ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios.

In this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding and will become conversant in the applications of several critical spectroscopy techniques to Structural Biology. Mainly through X-ray diffraction of crystals (XRD), but also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Microscopy (EM), the atomic view of the biological world is continuously expanding. Although this solves many mysteries of molecular function, our understanding of structure and function often requires the use of other complementary techniques, especially those that rely on the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological molecules, i.e., spectroscopy. These spectroscopic methods provide essential insights that are not accessible by the main structural techniques (XRD, NMR or EM), in the structural analysis of biomolecules, their dynamics, protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, or the role of these biomolecules in a cellular environment. Overall, the aim is that you can use the acquired understanding of these techniques and apply it to a series of problems with examples from the literature, understanding at the same time their limitations, for their integration in your future projects. Current practice of Structural Biology is critically dependent on such integration. From a professional perspective, each of these techniques is a world in itself, and familiarity with its applications will also be useful in your future potential links with industry.

During this one-week workshop, you will analyse the effect of inhibition of actin cytoskeleton regulators on epithelial mesenchymal transition using different molecular and cell biology experimental techniques. You will gain better insight into how scientific hypotheses are formulated based on existing data and how experiments are designed to test these hypotheses. You will appreciate the role of actin cytoskeleton in many cellular processes such as cell migration during metastasis. You will also develop skills in data acquisition and analysis, and scientific communication in terms of oral presentation and report writing.

This course aims to explore current topics of Immunological research in depth. In this course, you will learn how to critically review scientific findings in the field of immunology, and subsequently ask valid scientific questions. Thus, the course will extend your knowledge and further develop your critical thinking skills in the context of immunological research. You are expected to read and interpret original research publications and perform extensive literature search on selected topics in immunology. In addition to the 10 lectures of selected subjects, this course also requires you to present an assigned research paper and compose an original research proposal. Finally, you will propose experimental strategies to solve the problems in the research proposal. In this way, you are encouraged to utilize the knowledge you have acquired throughout your studies, instead of just memorizing facts. This course should help you to develop some of the problem solving skills required for a career in research.

High throughput sequencing has made it possible to quantify the genomes and transcriptomes of any species. Transcriptome sequencing can produce evidence about molecular responses to environmental stimuli, whereas genome sequencing is used to study the evolution and adaptation in the particular species. In this course you will develop skills to process and analyze both genome and transcriptome sequencing data from most common sequencing platforms and to carry out data analysis in species with or without a reference genome. Practical analysis is done using free and open-source software tools with an emphasis on the command-line Linux computing environment.
