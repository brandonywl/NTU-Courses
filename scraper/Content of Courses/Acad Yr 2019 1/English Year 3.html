This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

This is a comprehensive introduction to medieval English literature, with a focus on the Middle English period. Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic "Age of Faith" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required.

The term 'renaissance,' meaning 'rebirth', was popularized by Jacob Burckhardt in the 19th century, and has since then been inseparable from the idea that a new kind of European individual emerged between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, along with humanism, capitalism, protestantism, empirical science and European imperialism. Burckhardt was writing about Catholic Italy, however, and the individuals this course will examine lived in England, under absolutist Tudor and Stuart monarchs, during a time when the Protestant reformation was giving rise to new democratic ideologies. These writers witnessed the systematic demolition of English Catholicism, and of the feudal society that it entailed, by Henry VIII and his children. The ensuing tension between monarchy and democracy resulted in the English civil war, a conflict which produced, among other things, Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost. The texts chosen for this course demonstrate that, despite the excitement produced by new discoveries in art, science and geography, the emotion of loss suffuses the literature of the century leading up to the civil war, and this must qualify any notion that the history of the English renaissance is an unambiguous progress-narrative. Rather, it is a period fraught with contradictions, contradictions that enabled the production of some unique works of literary art.

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

This subject seeks to investigate various fictional images of an oft-tumultuous contemporary world from the mid twentieth century to the present. The contemporary is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes and contemporary authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery.  Many contemporary authors engage with the relativisation of various kinds of values and we will closely consider the ways in which this tendency continually resurfaces.

What do literary scholars and critics do?  How do they approach literature within specific contexts?  How do they communicate with each other and with wider audiences?  What are the differences between Area Studies, Ethnic and National Studies, Cultural Studies, and Comparative Studies of literature?  What is the role of theory in literary study?  These are some of the questions addressed in this module.  Students will be exposed to various ways of reading and writing about literature, including New Criticism, literature and the other arts, structuralism and post-structuralism, new historicism, psychoanalytic and feminist theories, and ethical criticism in order to gain an understanding of the methodologies of literary analysis.  Readings and screenings will include Kiss of the Spider Woman and Dirty Pretty Things.

As we read we will consider the formulization of an "American" "Early" "Literature". Whatconstitutes "America" before 1789? Are these texts "literary"? Does our study of these textsrequire a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only Englishlanguage texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these ?secondary? histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?

This module explores a diverse range of African literatures ? including works from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

Can money buy happiness? What is the meaning of success? How can we alleviate poverty? Literature has dealt with these questions for centuries, if not millennia - from Aesop's fables through Shakespeare to the present time.

In this course, you will study a series of texts from the English-speaking world dealing with themes of money, success, and consumerism. You will learn about the mechanisms of an urban economy from John Dos Passos's sprawling Manhattan Transfer, deepen your understanding of greed through Frank Norris's cautionary tale McTeague, familiarize yourself with feminist economics through Agnes Smedley's long-neglected classic Daughter of Earth, and analyze the tensions between old and new money through F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Kevin Kwan's Crazy Rich Asians. In this way, the course offers an introduction to economic concepts and ideas through their dramatization in literature, while on a deeper level also exploring the timeless and universal questions prompted by this staging.

As part of the course requirements, you will complete one group presentation and one literary essay. In addition, you are expected to actively participate in class discussion. Through the creative project 'My Way to Wealth,' you will also reflect on your own attitude to personal success, drawing on both the course content and the wisdom of your peers.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

Cinema, like all cultural products, is political in some way or other.  By deploying race, gender, and class as critical categories of reading film, this course's approach seeks to examine the political and ideological implications and assumptions of film art as a popular cultural medium.  Brief introductions to theories on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ideology, and class will provide the framework for the viewing of classic and contemporary film from different cinematic cultures.

This subject will trace a line of development throughout modern drama from realism and naturalism to absurdism and post-modernist theatre. Among others, dramatists will include Strindberg, Ibsen, Pirandello, Brecht, Beckett, Churchill, and Shepherd as well as contemporary Singaporean dramatist Kuo Pao Kun. In addition to understanding how changing theatrical trends embody changing epistemological, ontological and ideological attitudes, students will also develop a powerful comparative appreciation of the interconnected evolution of Asian and Western drama.

Tracing its origins from nineteenth-century writing on the possibilities and threats both of technology and the newly established sciences to its generic reconstruction and intertextual revisiting over the centuries, the analysis of its most prominent as well as of recently rediscovered works aims to illustrate how science fiction has transformed literature and film. In this, it also seeks to map the genre's most defining topoi: travel through space, time, and parallel universes; experimental technology; alien life; testing the boundaries of the mind and manipulating the body (cloning). Science fiction has always been experimental in its technique as well as in its critique of social, psychological, and scientific definitions of selfhood, and its study taps into encompassing explorations of epistemological as well as ontological anxieties.

We will begin with Plato's Symposium, and move on to recent theorizations and philosophies of love.  More than simply addressing thematic concerns, this course will approach love as a philosophy and a discursive practice, as well as address the issues of subjectivity, the Self-Other relation and difference, all of which are central to love. Our final aim is to evaluate the potential for love to serve as a discourse of alterity.  We will be covering a variety of discourses and texts: philosophy, psychoanalysis, feminism and literary theory; film and literary works by both male and female authors and poets.

This module explores a diverse range of Latin American literatures - including works from Brazil,
Argentina, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. It will offer an historical account of the emergence
and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and
political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the transcultural  'contact zone' created by colonialism, the  ideological and socioeconomic consequences of slavery, and the enduring conflict
between tradition and modernity. We will also  be discussing the early chronicles of discovery  and
conquest, the significance of magical realism as a mode of representation, and the subgenre of the
dictator novel

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of' - and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World
War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.'
There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not
identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their	shared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as	 you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.

Course Content
The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the
audience to confront the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Each week, we will look	closely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in	1, class. The course will provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time, humour and suffering.

Globalisation has been the driving force of cultural and economic flows for decades, if not	 centuries, yet we now stand at an historical moment where globalisation is undergoing rigorous interrogation all over the world. This module examines literary works that represent 'globa l cities' - cities that are particularly open to global flows of cultural products, capital, resources (including energy), and people. By inviting you to explore a range of literary forms that feature and respond to Singapore, London, Abu Dha bi and Johannesburg (among others), this module exami nes what global city texts can add to our understanding of world literature as a system and body of work. Students with an interest in globalisation, world literature and literary theory more broadly will thrive on this module and gain strong theoretical foundations to take into future studies, whilst also gaining a renewed    appreciation of global cultura	a and economic dynamics.

By first tracing the ideas of major feminist scholars, this course assesses the impact of feminist theory on the contemporary study of gender identity, politics, and representation, particularly in relation to literary and cultural theory.  Students will also engage theoretical and literary texts, covering a variety of genres and media, from emerging disciplines such as gender studies, masculinity studies, queer studies, and sexuality studies.

This course allows students to take a more focused approach to Victorian literature and culture. By providing a thematic, rather than a chronological, introduction to a number of nineteenth-century literary texts, it aims to show that the shifts in literary representations at the time were part of an extremely versatile cultural scene that belies any retrospective typecasting of "Victorianism." The comparison of canonical Victorian works and only recently reprinted material, primarily by long forgotten nineteenth-century women writers, will help us to understand the literary developments that engendered a plethora of controversies, both at the time and in its wake, brought out such a versatility of works, and perhaps above all, created the novel genre as the Victorian era's most popular, critical, and representative form of cultural expression.

This course looks at the aesthetics of modernism in relation to turn-of-the-century technological advances that changed auditory and visual perception. In particular, we will think about how mechanical reproduction, which was integral to photography, film, and the phonograph, influenced modernist writers. By closely examining the novels of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Alfred Doblin and John Dos Passos, we will question how modernist writers made use of perception-enhancing technologies both thematically and formally in their writing.

This module seeks to investigate various fictional images of the contemporary world. The contemporary, as it appears in the novels on this course, is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes.  These authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery in society and are keenly aware of the multi-racial/religious natures of their cities and towns.  Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel.  Thus, it is possible to consider their work as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain.

With the last two novels (by Gunesekera and Gupta respectively), we will engage definitional concerns, that is, we will look at how writers try to escape the perennial absorptionism versus enclavism debate that constrains ?minority writing.?

Literature and Medicine seeks to present health as a contested term with a continually evolving set of principles and meanings. The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century.

Sociological readings on the history and philosophy of medicine that signal the inadequa-cy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically and geographically sit-uated.

Novels concerned with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our understanding of health and sickness. 

Material from the emergent field of the medical humanities including anthropology and cultural studies, literature and applied linguistics, performing arts, visual art, and creative practices with a focus on healing and recovery.

Supplementary material on approaches to delivering humanities into healthcare and the requirement for practice based evidence.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
