Entrepreneurs are the creators and builders of new ventures that not only fulfill their own dreams, bring them huge fortune but also make a strong impact on the society and improve the lives of people. A successful venture will lead to new or improved products/services, create new jobs and add values for owners, investors and the society. Starting up a venture is not difficult if you know how although a successful venture requires more than knowledge on entrepreneurship. This course is an exploration into the fundamentals of entrepreneurship. Upon successful completion of the course, you would have a good understanding of entrepreneurship; the issues encountered on the entrepreneurial journey; and most importantly, how you can become an entrepreneur yourself. Specifically, the course covers aspects of accounting and finance essential for entrepreneurial venture, basic concepts on commercialization of technology, management of intellectual property and entry and exit strategies.

The start-up and growth of an enterprise invariably involves both human and financial capital. To manage the increasing pool of human resources and to convince venture capitalists to invest become two main issues especially for growing ventures. 

This module consists of two parts: in the first part, organization and human resource management are introduced; in the second part, the focus is on writing a convincing business plan to attract venture capital investment.

While ET9134 let students experience the process of creating and managing a business in the virtual environment, in this module, students are required to launch an actual business.  

This module allows students to experience the critical role of opportunity creation & recognition, and to practice the method of evaluating new venture concepts.  Essentially this course integrates what students have learned in earlier parts of the Entrepreneurship Minor.  Throughout this module, students will be exposed to the many 'ups and downs' that starting and operating a new business venture and / or an under-performing or `turn-around company' entails.
