Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

This course aims to provide students with necessary knowledge in using statistical tools for their own research projects.  Commonly used techniques in linguistic/psychological research, such as t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression etc., will be covered.  Students will NOT be tested on formulae, instead, the focus is on how to make use of computer software, such as Excel and SPSS, to organise data, present observation and conduct statistical analysis.  Students will also gain experience on how to write up empirical findings in a language acceptable by the field which will at the same time learn how to critically read statistics reported in prescribed readings from other courses.  Through this problem-based approach students will gain a deeper understanding of statistics.  Students who have no prior knowledge in statistics are more than welcome to enrol.

`A Wor(l)d in Motion: the sociolinguistics of globalization' is an advanced course aimed at reexamining the understanding of human communication in the age of globalization. As a research agenda, the sociolinguistics of globalization represents a relatively new, but rapidly growing and vibrant interdisciplinary approach to the place and role of language in the contemporary flows of people, capital, ideas, world views, cultural artefacts and representations. Change, mobility and flux have come to characterize contemporary social life and social imagination, and this course will be a forum for students to engage with the relevant readings that grapple with these issues from a sociolinguistic perspective. Throughout the course, we will be examining conditions and themes that have come to occupy a prominent place in the sociolinguistic research program. We will identify what new theoretical and methodological notions we need to add to our `traditional' sociolinguistic repertoire in order to scrutinize communication and emergent regimes of language in the contexts of superdiversity, spatial and symbolic mobility, globalized economic markets, tourism, war and terrorism.

In this course you will learn about the connection between language and social factors, such as social class, ethnicity, and identity. In this course you will also discover how social dialects mark specific social groups or classes. As sociolinguistics these days are typically concerned with social variation, this course aims to review core studies in sociolinguistics that have informed research on social-class variation in language. This course also provides you with training in quantitative sociolinguistic research from various backgrounds in language variation studies.

The course begins with an overview of natural language processing (NLP) to situate speech synthesis and recognition within industry and reviews familiar applications of these systems. Necessary topics concerning phonetics and phonology are introduced/reviewed, with a particular focus on acoustic phonetics. The topic of speech synthesis is then covered, with a focus on concatenative synthesis and statistical parametric systems, but formant-based and articulatory synthesis will also be covered in detail. In relation to these latter topics, students will learn about modeling the structures of the vocal tract to produce articulatory-based systems and the types of applications these have in speech research. Next the topic of speech recognition is covered. Students will learn about the design parameters of these systems and the tie-ins with other topics in NLP (such as language models and syntactic and semantic parsers). The Hidden Markov Model will be discussed in detail and its application to the task of recognizing speech in conjunction with acoustic analysis and modeling of the speech signal.

Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
