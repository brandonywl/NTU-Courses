A thematically structured critical introduction to the subject of history: its meanings,
frameworks, interpretations, schools of thought, practitioners and its uses and abuses.
The subject will analyze both the traditional and new methods of studying, analyzing
and interpreting the past and its relationship to our present and the future. This exciting
debate on the concepts, practices and critiques of history will be framed by in-depth
analysis of selected case studies that provide further critical insights into the discipline
and its relationship with other scholarly disciplines.

Asia-Pacific in Global History: From 1800 examines major themes which inform the
study of world history following the start of the 19th century, particularly in two related
areas: trade and migration against the backdrop of colonialism, imperialism and nationbuilding.
The study of global history from an Asia-Pacific perspective looks at the history
of globalization which is not strictly defined in economic terms, but is informed by
themes, such as migration, environment, imperialism, biological exchange, etc. Even
though the year chosen is 1800, the foundation for changes which marked China and
Asia`s entry into the global economic system was laid in the middle of the 18th century.
In particular, one can point to the institution of the Canton system established by the
Chinese government to facilitate foreign trade, but which had various unforeseen
economic, social, and political repercussions. Through 13 weeks of lectures, students
will not only examine various themes such as migration, diaspora, colonialism,
nationalism, and trade which relate generally to global historical studies, but they will
also participate in current debates pertaining to the issues of global economic crises
and climate change.

This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

This course offers a comparative study of issues related to the history of biology and the uses of biological knowledge in East Asia. Biomedical technologies, biosecurity, biodiversity, and biobanking number among various issues that increasingly pertain to biopolitics. Used to describe 17th century shifts in sovereign power, Foucault raised the term biopolitics, along with anatomo-politics, to describe how different levels of life became increasingly regulated, from species-centric populations to individual bodies, respectively. Issues that involve the biological occur in many different locations with different styles of governance, but analyses of biopolitics have tended to relate more to European history. Within the grain of Asian history, the study of issues that involve the biological requires a questioning of existing theoretical frameworks used to examine the politicization of life. This class explores imperial, colonial, and national experiences in East Asia in order to examine how various societies, polities, and people have authored, approached, and interpreted knowledge about different levels of regenerative life. HH1001 highly recommended in preparation of this course.

The course is a social and intellectual history of pre-modern Japan, mapping both institutional shifts and the distinct cultures that emerged in the early Buddhist temple complexes of ancient Nara, in women's quarters of the Heian court of Kyoto, in the medieval capita l of Kamakura, among the samurai of the Wa rring States Period and in the tea houses and pleasure districts of Edo (early Tokyo). The course will engage the Japanese experience from a wide range of thematic and cultural perspectives. Themes will include political and military cultures, the machinations of court intrigue, the brilliant and melancholy litera ry productions of aristocratic women, the rise of a Buddhist intelligentsia, and the emergence of the high arts that have come to define what we all know and love about Japanese culture today.

Food constitutes a vital aspect of Chinese culture that figures saliently both in China and beyond. It forms a significant aspect of heritage identification for many ethnic communities in Singapore. This course uses the lens of food to explore Chinese history and various historical methodologies.  Students will assess the complex ways that food connects not only to daily life, through cooking and eating, as spice and as medicine, from the expression and formation of the self to the mediation of social relationship, but to larger histories of trade, ecology, medicine, religion, agriculture, travel and ethnic identity.

Burma/Myanmar: A History introduces you to the development of cultures, peoples, polities, and societies which occupy the territory of what constitutes the modern nation-state of Myanmar.  The course draws materials from archaeology, history, and art history. By drawing case studies, examples, images and readings, the course helps you to acquire elementary skills to interpret the information you learn in the class meetings. Once you can identify and contrast available data, you will be able to compose historical narratives surveying and evaluating societies and peoples of Burma/Myanmar from ancient times to the present day. Discussion about the case studies is significant because the sites examined formed the early connecting nodes of what might have been an extensive network of technology transfer along the north-south and east-west corridors linking China and India via mainland Southeast Asia. You will also learn what sources are available, how scholars used these sources, and how they come to write the essays they wrote.

History of Global Capitalism introduces you to the discipline of economic history. Beginning with the rise of capitalism in the West, the module tracks the development of capitalism, its spread throughout the world, and the challenges it has faced. The module also introduces the major themes and debates in the new field of the history of capitalism, including the Industrial Revolution, the East-West divide, the entanglement of economics and geopolitics during the two world wars and the Cold War, and the increasingly important roles of gender and technology in our discussions on capitalism. We will also look at case studies of post-WWII America and China?s Economic Reforms starting from the late 1970s. This course also helps you to develop the skills to turn textual as well as numerical data into analytical historical writings. Through this course, you will become familiar with the different approaches to economic history and the methodological developments in the field, and learn what kinds of sources economic historians use and how they use them.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

The Green Earth covers some of the most important themes in environmental history
which have informed academic scholarship during the last 20 to 30 years. The course
begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and
development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation
of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of
warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had
brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course
focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions
of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to
elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject
of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous
desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and
pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals,
particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction
of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several
millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have
lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at
the end of the course.

This course is about the history of Southeast Asia and the Cold War. It aims to enlighten
students on the origins and course of the conflict in the subregion in the global context.
It also seeks to help students appreciate the cultural, diplomatic, economic, political,
and social impacts of the twentieth century global conflict on Southeast Asia. In addition,
the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and
international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the
multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast
Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and
national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement
in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia
from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will
discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians
had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history.

In order to understand past events, it is also important to understand why certain actors did what they did to influence the course of events. In other words, what did these actors think and how did they understand the world around them? Using an intellectual history framework, this course looks at the main themes and debates of twentieth-century China through the angle of some of its main thinkers, thereby paying attention to the specific contexts in which intellectuals put forward these ideas. Among others, we will look into socialism, liberalism, conservatism, and nationalism; the various debates we will study address the nature of Chinese modernity and its economic, political, and cultural tenets.

Starting in the late nineteenth century, when exchange programs and contact with foreigners in China led intellectuals to question their existing worldviews, this course moves chronologically and thematically across the twentieth century. From the late 1800s, we move on to intellectuals of the important May Fourth era?including thinkers of various political persuasions?as well as Mao Zedong thought. In a final section, intellectual developments of modern China will be linked to contemporary outgrowths. We will briefly discuss liberal thinkers of the so-called ?second Enlightenment? period, the 1980s, after which the course will conclude with the rise of New Confucianism and debates between the New Left and liberal intellectuals during the 1990s.

In this course, you will examine how colonial Singapore combined both western and folk medical practices in Singapore. This course will analyze the co-existence of Western tropical medicine and folk immigrant medical practices, the role of missionary nurses and doctors and their relationship to colonial medicine and policy and lastly, the course will study the use of epidemiology in Singapore during the 1918 influenza pandemic. 

The course will be divided into two six-week blocks, each covering colonial Western medicine and folk medical practices history respectively. By comparing the political, economic, and social changes that happened in the West and East during the same historical periods, we will be able to see how the interplay of global and local hegemonic forces shaped medical practices that we know today. The course would further examine Western and Eastern medical practices by studying the history of Eu Yan Sang and Tiger Balm and how it developed in colonial Singapore, the developments and contributions of hospitals and medical staffs-such as Tan Tock Seng hospital-and lastly, the 1918 Influenza Pandemic in Singapore.
