This course adopts a blended learning approach where asynchronous e-learning and synchronous teaching in seminar setting are combined to achieve learning objectives. Weekly seminar provides the channel to exchange understanding and best coding practice. You will learn through a wide range of learning materials, such as online references, textbooks, videos, pre-readings, in-class activities, coding discussion and paired work. 

This course first provides an overview of the development environment of Python and R programming language. You will then move on to pick up language semantics like coding syntax, variables, methods, functions, mathematical operators, Boolean operators, decisions, compound decision, control structures and iterations. These help you to build a holistic understanding of programming basics and the ability to write code independently. The course will also cover foundation of business analytics including how to define problem statement in business context, data preparation, data transformation, data consolidation, data analysis, and data visualization.

This course introduces participants to analyses, design, tools, techniques, and issues concerning the management of data. Data management is the foundation for organizations? business analytics; and for problem solving and decision-making. Participants will analyse a variety of business process, identify data requirements and develop an information system to support business processes and gather information for business analytics. In this course, participants will have an opportunity to apply their design and development competencies by working closely with non-profit organizations to implement an information systems prototype.

The learning goals of this course are to develop a range of competencies necessary for the domain of business analytics. These competencies include analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills, and technical and interpersonal skills. In-class exercises and the semester project will facilitate the internalization of these competencies. Through cooperative learning and real-world problems, participants will learn to work as consulting teams within a real operating organizational context. More importantly, participants of this course will learn how to learn new concepts, technologies and techniques.

Upon successful completion of this course, participants will have gained competencies to identify and analyze business-related problems, to use appropriate technologies to resolve these problems, to evaluate alternative solutions, to make appropriate recommendations and to develop a prototype of their recommended solution.

Most organizations are data rich and information poor. The large volumes of data in an organization are 'oilfields' rich in information content that are pending extraction with the right tools and models. Analytics involves the art of data exploration, visualization, communication and the science of analyzing large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and useful insights to support decision-making. The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to various techniques available to extract useful insights from the large volumes of data. At the end of the course, students will not only see the substantial opportunities that exist in the business analytics realm, but also learn techniques that allow them to exploit these opportunities.

2.	gain an understanding of the methodologies, tools and techniques necessary for analyzing, implementing, managing and continuously improving lean operations in both manufacturing and service industries. 

3.	develop an appreciation of applications of Toyota Production System, Value Stream Mapping, Pull Systems, Lean thinking in banking and healthcare operations. 

4.	use simulation for modeling and analyzing real life systems

5.	communicate ideas/ insights of business/operations analytics solutions


Content

Topics covered in the course include Toyota Production System, Lean Principles, Value Stream Mapping, Pull Systems, Lean thinking in banking and healthcare operations, and use of simulation for modeling and analyzing real life systems.

Business Analytics Consulting is a career option that provides incumbents an opportunity for challenging work, continued self-development, access to important social and professional networks, and, over time, significant financial rewards. The consulting profession offers work opportunities in large global organizations that practice in a variety of business settings and business disciplines, and in small firms offering niche/boutique services. In addition many businesses have developed internal consulting organizations to provide consulting related services within the organization and often in conjunction with consulting services offered by third party firms.

This is an applications course exposing participants to the profession of business analytics consulting. The course is designed to develop an appreciation of the art and science of providing recommendations to client organizations/departments.

"Services represent the fastest growing sector of any developed economy. In the United States, this sector is responsible for nearly 75% of GDP and 80% of employment. Similarly, 75% of GDP and 70% of jobs in Singapore are generated by services. This trend persists in other industrialized nations. Moreover, these figures under-represent the actual role and significance of services in the economy because many manufacturing firms are increasingly involved in service-type jobs such as design, distribution, financial planning, customization, and after-sales services. That said, it is important for any manager (or student of management) to understand how services differ from manufacturing operations, and how toefficiently and effectively manage service operations.

In the first 7 weeks of the course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for designing, managing, analyzing, and improving service operations. Students will also learn to use analytical models and decision support tools for improving the operational effectiveness and efficiency in service organizations. Topics covered include Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Quality, Process Management, Project Management, Forecasting, Queue Management, Workforce Scheduling, and Capacity & Demand Management. 

The remaining weeks will focus on understanding the basics of service operations in the hospitality industry. Specific topics such as Front Office Management, F&B Management, Housekeeping, Facility Maintenance, and Revenue Management will be covered in this segment.

The goals of the course are:
1.   to provide an understanding and appreciation of the service functions of firms related to the
      Hospitality and Tourism industry,
2.   to understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to succeed in
      designing and managing service operations. The teaching method used is seminar style
      with a mix of lectures, in-class problem solving, discussions, video showing, and facility
      tours."
