This course provides you with a working understanding on significant intellectual property (IP) protection regimes in Singapore, covering copyright, patents, registered design, trade marks and trade secrets and the relevant legislation and legal principles. 

The central aim of the course is providing students with the ability to identify, differentiate and apply various aspects of these IP regimes in connection with a business?s intellectual asset outputs. 

Particular emphasis will be placed on the legal issues in relation to creation, protection, and exploitation of these intellectual assets. Within this context, the course explores how analysing IP rights protection laws and their considerations can guide a business?s IP strategies, and how a business is able to use such IP considerations to assess the viability of potential courses of action and their plausible business implications. The business may be operating within the chemical industry.

To learn process engineering in a more advanced level through knowing and practising the subject matters commonly adopted in the industry, such as formulizing design basis in detail, application of the relevant API, IS, ASME codes and standards, preparation of deliverables and time sensitive deliverables, interface issues with other disciplines etc. To build further analytical skillsets to solve more complex and sophisticated industry problems. To link theories to real-life industry problems through solving case studies.

This course would enable students to embark on their professional careers without much on-the-job training and have satisfaction in early stage of their careers being able to deliver products independently. More importantly, this course will help the students to find suitable employment easily in Singapore and other countries.

This seminar course will introduce the students to the Food Industry in Singapore, Asia and beyond. Prominent speakers from various Food MNCs, local SMEs, and regulatory bodies (AVA and/or WHO) will be invited to present every week on various topics and food issues. This will also give the students a valuable opportunity to interact personally with food industries and have a deeper understanding of the food policies and issues around the world.

This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar.

A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport.

Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too.

In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all.

This module covers the fundamental notions of cost-benefit analysis;  a method of evaluating the relative merits of alternative public investment projects or programmes in order to achieve economic efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources.  In a way, cost-benefit analysis identifies and assesses the factors which need to be considered in making rational economic choices.  In addition to understanding the theory and applying the principles behind cost-benefit analysis, some further complementary techniques drawn from decision sciences will be taught.  The welfare foundations of cost-benefit analysis will be emphasized throughout the module.  Topics covered will include identification and measurement of benefits and costs; investment decision criteria; risk and uncertainty; problems of distribution and equity; and particular problems in project evaluation.

This course studies urban spaces from an economist's perspective. Why do cities exist, and what are the benefits - and costs - of organizing economic and social activity in close proximity? Students taking this course will apply intermediate microeconomic theory and micro-econometrics to the analysis of cities and urban problems. Students will also be expected to understand and interpret contemporary empirical economic research into urban problems. Fundamental contributions from other social sciences and disciplines to the study of urban economic activity will also be discussed.

In line with the course's objectives, students will be assessed based on a group project based on the interpretation of existing contemporary research; an individual research paper; and a final examination testing knowledge and application of theory and concepts

In this course, we adopt the overlapping-generations model as the dynamic model to model the macro economy, and use a consistent approach based on microeconomic foundations and the rationality of economic agents to address several issues in monetary policy, exchange-rate policy and fiscal policy. Among other issues, the issues in monetary policy studied here include the welfare effects of an increasing stock of fiat money, the development of financial intermediaries in the presence of differences in the rates of return between illiquid capital and money, and the reasons for the observed correlation between the nominal money stock and real output. The issues in exchange-rate policy studied here include the implications of different international monetary systems, the determination of exchange rates in the presence of currency controls and the indeterminacy of exchange rates when people are free to hold currencies of their choice.

Personnel Economics is the application of economic and mathematical approaches and econometric and statistical methods to traditional topics in the study of human resources management. Compared to the standard labor economics courses, this course focuses more on the internal labor market within firms. This includes topics such as compensation, turnover, incentives, and compensation that are inherently economic, as well as those that do not at first appear to be economic topics, such as norms, teamwork, worker empowerment, and peer relationships. It has become a rapid developing research field since its birth and, as a course, has been taught in many top universities and MBA programs. The current course is a general introduction to this emerging field of researches and the human resource management in practice. We analyze the efficient allocation and motivation of employees as well as their development of skills within a company. We discuss recruiting mechanisms, training strategies and efficient compensation schemes. The course also has a focus on recent empirical evidences within the field of personnel economics.

This course provides an introduction to econometric time series techniques that are widely used in analyzing economic data. The course will meet the needs of students who plan more advanced studies in this area. Students are instructed on the econometric time series techniques that can be used for empirical economic studies, as well as to analyze financial time series. Topics covered include stationary time-series models, trends and volatility modeling, models for time-varying volatility, univariate processes with unit roots, multiequation time-series models, cointegration and the error-correction models.
