This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

Shooting visual effects has increasingly become a part of the skillset required of mainstream camera teams, no longer limited to specialised VFX Units. 

This course aims to introduce you to the skills that you need to acquire to be able to shoot VFX elements competently. It will also enable you to participate in pre and post production discussions about workflows and strategy for cinematography, film-making, animation, and film directing. 

These principles of VFX will inform any use of both physical and digital VFX in subsequent media courses, and are also relevant for those interested in supervising on-set visual effects.

Consisting of a series of lectures, film viewings and workshops, Documentary Filmmaking explores the different t genres and practices of the cinematic non-fiction film form. The course covers a brief history and theory of the documentary as political propaganda, investigative essay, personal journal, and cinema verite observation, through the study of documentary auteurs. You will develop an understanding of the ethical precepts, as well as an appreciation of the aesthetics and intellectual rigour of the documentary form. 

Through practice, you will be exposed to the fundamentals of documentary filmmaking. The course seeks to develop your ability to identify, conceptualise and research a topic, negotiate access to characters or events, manage a production through efficient budgeting and scheduling, and create a short non-fiction cinematic narrative with coherent artistic vision and intellectual purpose. 

Assessment will take the form of:

Documentary Film project 
Working in groups of 2, teams will write, shoot, direct and edit a video documentary. You may shoot no more than 60 minutes of video per group and the finished films should be 4-6 minutes long, complete with titles and credits. Includes oral pitches. The films are to submitted as self-contained MOV files.  

Continuous Assessment
Continuous assessment components include both written and studio-based exercises.

What is Sound?
Overview of the physics of sound and psychoacoustics. How we hear; frequency, amplitude, pitched and non-pitched sounds. Noise and types of noise. Listening to sound and developing a vocabulary to discuss it critically.

Microphones:
An investigation into the properties and operating principles of modern microphones. What the various types of microphone are and how we chose the best one for a particular application. Inverse square law, phase cancellation and proximity effect as related to the use of microphones.

Production Sound Recording:
Single and Dual system recording is explored in the context of recording dialog for fiction and non-fiction films. Location mixers, recorders, laviller and shotgun microphones will be examined and utilised in practical exercises. Correct protocols and techniques for on set dialog recording will investigated with a consideration of the aesthetics of dialog recording. Critical listening to identify and correct sound recording errors will be developed.

Post Production:
Delivering production sound to the editor including correct sound coverage and a complete sound report will be explored. Synchronising sound and image in picture editing software and exporting  sound and image from this software using the correct output formats. Basics of editing sound in audio editing software with an emphasis on understanding how production recording influences post production sound editing. Post production processing techniques including noise reduction, compression and EQ will be introduced and examined.

Class assignments:
There are four in class dialog recording assignments that explore various shooting scenarios and recording systems. The final 2 assignments include a dialogue editing component. There will also be 2 in class quizzes covering more theoretical aspects of sound, sound recording and post production.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

Cinema, like all cultural products, is political in some way or other.  By deploying race, gender, and class as critical categories of reading film, this course's approach seeks to examine the political and ideological implications and assumptions of film art as a popular cultural medium.  Brief introductions to theories on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ideology, and class will provide the framework for the viewing of classic and contemporary film from different cinematic cultures.
