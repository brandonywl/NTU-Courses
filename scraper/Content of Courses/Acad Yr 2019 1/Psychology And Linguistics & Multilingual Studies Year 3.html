Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

Students will learn a scripting language (Python) and use it and the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) to analyse linguistic phenomena. The following topics will be covered in detail:
	File input/output
	Control Structures
	Frequency Distributions
	Regular Expressions
	Access to lexical resources
	Classification

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

This course aims to provide students with necessary knowledge in using statistical tools for their own research projects.  Commonly used techniques in linguistic/psychological research, such as t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression etc., will be covered.  Students will NOT be tested on formulae, instead, the focus is on how to make use of computer software, such as Excel and SPSS, to organise data, present observation and conduct statistical analysis.  Students will also gain experience on how to write up empirical findings in a language acceptable by the field which will at the same time learn how to critically read statistics reported in prescribed readings from other courses.  Through this problem-based approach students will gain a deeper understanding of statistics.  Students who have no prior knowledge in statistics are more than welcome to enrol.

`A Wor(l)d in Motion: the sociolinguistics of globalization' is an advanced course aimed at reexamining the understanding of human communication in the age of globalization. As a research agenda, the sociolinguistics of globalization represents a relatively new, but rapidly growing and vibrant interdisciplinary approach to the place and role of language in the contemporary flows of people, capital, ideas, world views, cultural artefacts and representations. Change, mobility and flux have come to characterize contemporary social life and social imagination, and this course will be a forum for students to engage with the relevant readings that grapple with these issues from a sociolinguistic perspective. Throughout the course, we will be examining conditions and themes that have come to occupy a prominent place in the sociolinguistic research program. We will identify what new theoretical and methodological notions we need to add to our `traditional' sociolinguistic repertoire in order to scrutinize communication and emergent regimes of language in the contexts of superdiversity, spatial and symbolic mobility, globalized economic markets, tourism, war and terrorism.

In this course you will learn about the connection between language and social factors, such as social class, ethnicity, and identity. In this course you will also discover how social dialects mark specific social groups or classes. As sociolinguistics these days are typically concerned with social variation, this course aims to review core studies in sociolinguistics that have informed research on social-class variation in language. This course also provides you with training in quantitative sociolinguistic research from various backgrounds in language variation studies.

The course begins with an overview of natural language processing (NLP) to situate speech synthesis and recognition within industry and reviews familiar applications of these systems. Necessary topics concerning phonetics and phonology are introduced/reviewed, with a particular focus on acoustic phonetics. The topic of speech synthesis is then covered, with a focus on concatenative synthesis and statistical parametric systems, but formant-based and articulatory synthesis will also be covered in detail. In relation to these latter topics, students will learn about modeling the structures of the vocal tract to produce articulatory-based systems and the types of applications these have in speech research. Next the topic of speech recognition is covered. Students will learn about the design parameters of these systems and the tie-ins with other topics in NLP (such as language models and syntactic and semantic parsers). The Hidden Markov Model will be discussed in detail and its application to the task of recognizing speech in conjunction with acoustic analysis and modeling of the speech signal.

In this course we will examine how language is represented and learnt in the brain.  Cutting-edge findings from state of the art techniques using functional neuroimaging and lesion studies will be reviewed to enable students to understand the workings of the human brain in relation to language use. Specific aspects of language processing such as meaning representation, speech perception and learning, learning disabilities as well as the bilingual brain will be introduced. Basic neuroanatomy will also be covered to enable students to pursue further studies. This course introduces functional neuroimaging at an advanced level.

Theories of grammar can be divided into structural, formal and functional models. Taking a selection of grammatical categories - such as relative clauses, passive, case, subject, non-configurational syntax etc. (these may change from year to year depending upon the coordinator) - we will compare how effective each theoretical model of syntax is in accounting for the same sets of linguistic data. The topics for investigation will be determined in the first seminar in consultation with students; these will then be considered from the perspective of (i) classical structuralism, (ii) generative theories including Government and Binding, Lexical Functional grammar, and Head-driven Phrase structure Grammar, and finally (iii) Functional-Typological theories such as Role and Reference Grammar and usage-based models such as Radical Construction Grammar.

In this unit we focus on how we understand what someone is trying to communicate to us when they say or write something to us, especially how the particular words and structures are used for the purpose of getting us to understand just what the speaker intends. Given that the meaning of a word or structure depends on how it is used, we will look at the physical and cultural contexts within which communication occurs and develop an understanding of the role they play in the communication of meaning.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

The course will cover three main areas: experimental design, acoustic methods, perceptual methods. It is necessary to fully understand the tools and techniques used to properly implement experiments and to interpret the resulting data. Emphasis is placed on the design of phonetic and phonological experiments using electronic systems and introducing computer technology for speech analysis. Therefore, in addition to the sections on experimental methodology there will be a significant portion of the course devoted to mastering computer-based acoustic analysis.

Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

This laboratory course is designed to help students effectively apply, interpret, and evaluate different multivariate statistical techniques. Conceptual understanding, including appropriate circumstances for use of each technique, the development of practical ?how-to? skills, and an understanding of the trade-offs made in technique choice will be emphasized. Students will gain hands-on experience through several project assignments throughout the semester. These assignments will require students to learn how to draw statistical and substantive conclusions from the results of their analyses. Students will prepare written summaries of results using APA or accepted writing guidelines that are common formats for journals in psychology. Topics covered in this course include factor analysis, MANOVA, logistic regression and discriminant analysis, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, etc.

This applied module covers an introduction to the forensic psychology of crime, terrorism and disasters. This course will benefit those who have an interest in working in or with the police, prisons, civil defence, child custody areas, community forensic psychology as well as counselling, clinical and/or forensic settings. It will provide a ?realistic preview? of the work of a psychologist working in applied forensic contexts. Additionally, because working in forensic setting can be stressful, distressing and sometimes traumatic (e.g. dealing with bereaving families or dealing with potentially challenging clientele), this module also discusses employee assistance infrastructures such as counselling and peer counselling programs within police and law enforcement organizations. An applied psychologist working in police, fire or other law enforcement settings would need to appreciate how aspects of counselling psychology, criminological/legal psychology and organizational psychology all come together to address the real world problems faced in applied forensic settings.

The aim of this course is to outline how best available research is integrated with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preference to achieve evidence-based practice in clinical psychology. The course covers empirically supported treatments (cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic) for major problem areas (depression, personality disorders, neuropsychological impairment) and examines elements of effective therapy relationships (empathy, working alliance, collecting patient feedback) as well as effective methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient (reactance/resistance level, preferences, culture, religion and spirituality). This course aims to encourage a critical stance when considering the empirical status of treatment models and their clinical applications and provides hands-on experience in adopting elements of a therapeutic relationship.

This applied module aims to introduce you to the theories and practices of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (Occupational Psychology) as applied to individuals at work and to organisations. Students who have an interest in applying psychology to work settings will be exposed to a scope of topics that are relevant to the practice in both private and public sectors. 
 
The course aims to develop students? theoretical understanding as well as knowledge of the practical tools and solutions that are applied in the IO practice. The contextual learning is to help students understand the consulting cycle and stakeholder engagements unique to the IO practice. The intention is to provide the students a fairly comprehensive primer to what they may expect in further education and a career in the IO specialisation. 
 
The course will have a strong emphasis on applied skills. Each seminar will be structured such that students are exposed less to the theories of I/O Psychology and more to how they are practiced within organisations. This will include exposure to best guidelines as set by standard-setting bodies, commercial products and solutions commonly used in industry, and case studies to discuss the ethics of psychological societies of different nations.

This course covers the social and psychological processes that influence how people perceive, categorize, and behave towards those who belong to other groups (outgroups). Course content will especially focus on psychological and behavioral manifestations of problematic intergroup relations, such as stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. While prejudice and discrimination are typically associated with groups defined based on race and ethnicity, this course will also explore the psychology of intergroup relations in other domains, such as gender, age, teams, organizations, disability/illness, and stigmatized traits. In addition to offering lectures, readings, and presentations of empirical papers on the psychology of intergroup relations, students will also be encouraged to develop their own research questions through class discussion and writing assignments. The final project of the course will involve the application of knowledge gained through course activities to the preparation of the students' own research proposals.

Recent discoveries have overturned longstanding beliefs that the neurophysiology of the brain remains relatively fixed after childhood.  We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity.  For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs.

The study of death and dying is concerned with questions that are rooted at the core of human experience. Individuals who set out to increase their knowledge of mortality are embarking on life's most important exploration, a journey of personal discovery and spiritual awakening. Whilst acknowledging the finite nature of existence allows individuals to reflect upon the meaning of life to attend greater personhood, mortality also plays a pivotal role in defining cultural beliefs, family values and social structures. 

This course provides an interdisciplinary overview of the major psycho-socio-cultural perspectives, theories and clinical practices on death and dying from a global viewpoint with a critical focus on the Asian experience. Through interactive lectures, experiential workshops and creative group projects, students will be offered an opportunity to examine the psychological, socio-spiritual, ethical and political issues of mortality through a range of cultural lenses. Such exploration will facilitate insights, reflections and personal growth for enhancing students' capacity in dealing with the inevitability of morality, while equipping them with the core intellectual skills and values for living a meaningful and purposeful life.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
