This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in Art History and Theory. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their relevance to Art History and Theory in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire key critical skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and new insights.
Finally, you will present your responses, in the form of a written paper and oral presentations.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the questions and issues it provokes. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Paper.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

This course explores European visual culture created in response to contact and interaction with non-Western cultures from the fifteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Various European representations of the exotic Orient (Near and Far East) will be examined. The influence of European Imperialism upon the fine arts will be analysed in relation to eighteenth-century colonial landscape painting, the Romantic Orientalism of Eugene Delacroix, the work of Jean-Auguste Dominque Ingres and Jean-Leon Gerome, the popularization of the East in terms of Chinoiserie and Japonisme, primitivism in the work of Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso, and the odalisques of Matisse. The course will also look at the rise of ethnography and the ethnographic museum, and the role of photography and international exhibitions.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This course is designed for students who?ve already taken foundational Art History courses and chronologically follows DD3005 Survey of Modern Art 1900-1945. In this course you will be introduced to the moment of transformation from modern to contemporary art. It?s intended as a historical and conceptual framework for the development of critical thinking and visual analysis regarding today?s art practice. You will be introduced to a series of art forms and ideas, which still pervade the contemporary, 21st century global art world. You will examine the cultural and socio- political contexts through which these art forms and ways of thinking emerged. The analysis of these artistic contexts is essential for the understanding of a number of parallel situations in contemporary Southeast Asian art and will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on the contemporary.

This course is foundational for more advanced art historical studies. It seeks to initiate critical reflection on 'art' and 'art history' as variable constructs subject to shifting matrixes of interconnected factors and forces. Based on a range of visual and textual materials from the pre-modern to the contemporary, the East and the West, the 'North' and the 'South', this course investigates the ways of seeing, representing, interpreting and thinking about 'art' and 'art history'. The first part of the course examines pictorial strategies adopted by image-makers from different periods and parts of the world; the second part explores a selection of art historical theories from Europe, East and South Asia. This learning will provide a conceptual framework for further, in-depth studies in global Art History.

This course is designed to situate art and artists in a number of diverse spiritual, geographical and historical contexts and in so doing allow you to explore art history through a variety of human beliefs. This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings? to our eyes; analyze what Jocho?s Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

This course is intended to deepen and widen your pre-existing knowledge of Asian or Buddhist art, and to develop critical frameworks for rethinking prevailing canons of Buddhist art. It covers a selection of artefacts, sites and works of art from over two millennia from ca. 300BCE to the 21st century. The geographical scope mirrors the internationalisation of Buddhism, from South Asia to East, Southeast Asia, and the Western world, since the first millennium. We ask: how have Buddhist teachings been interpreted by image-makers over space and time, and how have the representations been subsequently experienced, read and used, and what makes 'Buddhist art' 'Buddhist' and 'art'? These studies will provide a basis for further in-depth studies of Buddhist Art.

This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

This course covers over one thousand years of English writing, from Anglo-Saxon to Neoclassical literature. We will focus primarily on the relationship between ?form? and ?history? in seeking to understand this literature, where ?form? refers to a given text?s genre or mode (e.g., ?revenge tragedy?), its linguistic and narrative characteristics, and so on, while ?history? means both material and cultural formations as these change through time. While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature?from deconstruction to queer theory?might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works. The course will touch upon a number of ?big? themes in English literature, with particular emphasis on the rise of individualism and the impact of the Reformation on early-modern culture and thought.

This is a comprehensive introduction to medieval English literature, with a focus on the Middle English period. Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic "Age of Faith" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required.

The term 'renaissance,' meaning 'rebirth', was popularized by Jacob Burckhardt in the 19th century, and has since then been inseparable from the idea that a new kind of European individual emerged between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, along with humanism, capitalism, protestantism, empirical science and European imperialism. Burckhardt was writing about Catholic Italy, however, and the individuals this course will examine lived in England, under absolutist Tudor and Stuart monarchs, during a time when the Protestant reformation was giving rise to new democratic ideologies. These writers witnessed the systematic demolition of English Catholicism, and of the feudal society that it entailed, by Henry VIII and his children. The ensuing tension between monarchy and democracy resulted in the English civil war, a conflict which produced, among other things, Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost. The texts chosen for this course demonstrate that, despite the excitement produced by new discoveries in art, science and geography, the emotion of loss suffuses the literature of the century leading up to the civil war, and this must qualify any notion that the history of the English renaissance is an unambiguous progress-narrative. Rather, it is a period fraught with contradictions, contradictions that enabled the production of some unique works of literary art.

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

This subject seeks to investigate various fictional images of an oft-tumultuous contemporary world from the mid twentieth century to the present. The contemporary is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes and contemporary authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery.  Many contemporary authors engage with the relativisation of various kinds of values and we will closely consider the ways in which this tendency continually resurfaces.

What do literary scholars and critics do?  How do they approach literature within specific contexts?  How do they communicate with each other and with wider audiences?  What are the differences between Area Studies, Ethnic and National Studies, Cultural Studies, and Comparative Studies of literature?  What is the role of theory in literary study?  These are some of the questions addressed in this module.  Students will be exposed to various ways of reading and writing about literature, including New Criticism, literature and the other arts, structuralism and post-structuralism, new historicism, psychoanalytic and feminist theories, and ethical criticism in order to gain an understanding of the methodologies of literary analysis.  Readings and screenings will include Kiss of the Spider Woman and Dirty Pretty Things.

As we read we will consider the formulization of an "American" "Early" "Literature". Whatconstitutes "America" before 1789? Are these texts "literary"? Does our study of these textsrequire a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only Englishlanguage texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these ?secondary? histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?

This module explores a diverse range of African literatures ? including works from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

Can money buy happiness? What is the meaning of success? How can we alleviate poverty? Literature has dealt with these questions for centuries, if not millennia - from Aesop's fables through Shakespeare to the present time.

In this course, you will study a series of texts from the English-speaking world dealing with themes of money, success, and consumerism. You will learn about the mechanisms of an urban economy from John Dos Passos's sprawling Manhattan Transfer, deepen your understanding of greed through Frank Norris's cautionary tale McTeague, familiarize yourself with feminist economics through Agnes Smedley's long-neglected classic Daughter of Earth, and analyze the tensions between old and new money through F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Kevin Kwan's Crazy Rich Asians. In this way, the course offers an introduction to economic concepts and ideas through their dramatization in literature, while on a deeper level also exploring the timeless and universal questions prompted by this staging.

As part of the course requirements, you will complete one group presentation and one literary essay. In addition, you are expected to actively participate in class discussion. Through the creative project 'My Way to Wealth,' you will also reflect on your own attitude to personal success, drawing on both the course content and the wisdom of your peers.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing.
