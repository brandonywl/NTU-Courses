This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

History of Global Capitalism introduces you to the discipline of economic history. Beginning with the rise of capitalism in the West, the module tracks the development of capitalism, its spread throughout the world, and the challenges it has faced. The module also introduces the major themes and debates in the new field of the history of capitalism, including the Industrial Revolution, the East-West divide, the entanglement of economics and geopolitics during the two world wars and the Cold War, and the increasingly important roles of gender and technology in our discussions on capitalism. We will also look at case studies of post-WWII America and China?s Economic Reforms starting from the late 1970s. This course also helps you to develop the skills to turn textual as well as numerical data into analytical historical writings. Through this course, you will become familiar with the different approaches to economic history and the methodological developments in the field, and learn what kinds of sources economic historians use and how they use them.

This course introduces students to the politics of migration in a globalised era. The perspectives of migrant inclusion and exclusion will be used to help students acquire a deeper understanding of the political, economic and social functions of borders; how states regulate migrants' access to citizenship; the role of security in migration regulation; the competing sets of political, economic and social demands states must satisfy in regulating migration; and how different categories of migrants are politically, economically and socially constructed. Students will be required to analyze and synthesize the above knowledge and articulate them in a cogent and accessible way, both orally and in writing.

'Globalization' refers to the increasing interaction and interdependence between peoples and places across the world. This course examines the interrelated cultural, economic and political processes that constitute globalization, and analyses their impact on individuals, groups, cities and nation-states. Emphasis is placed on understanding the multifaceted character of globalization and the debates that it has engendered. Specific themes include the spread of global capitalism, the global consequences of technological advancements in transport and communications (especially the Internet), the expansion of consumer culture, issues of global governance, and new cultural formations.

This course is designed to introduce contemporary forms of migration and their implications for living within diverse and multicultural societies through sociological concepts and key perspectives.  This course will give students a broad understanding of the central issues associated with migration and settlement, with an attempt to focus on south-south migrations and generate conversation with more commonly studied South to North movements of people. The first half of the course will address various types of migration and key transnational framings of the movements of people across domestic and international boundaries. In the second half, the ways in which various states deal with the diversity of their temporary and more permanent immigrant populations will be explored. This is done using a case study approach that allows for a deeper understanding of each site. Finally, the course introduces some elements of everyday migrant life in order to provide a balance to highly state-centric readings of migration. The course seeks to link issues of migration with understandings of contemporary multiculturalism so that they can be examined as interrelated transnational phenomena. In these discussions, class and ethnicity emerge as key vectors of differentiation and analysis.

This is an introductory core module for the minor in Geography and Urban Planning. It is an introduction to the study of society and space and its organization. In addition to foundational themes in human geography and their implications for urban planning, we will also cover some of the most pressing socio-spatial issues in our world today. These topics will draw out the wide-ranging local-global connections in the fields of social, cultural, urban, political and economic geography. We will draw upon case studies from Singapore and around the world to provide empirical contexts to the concepts discussed in lectures.  Through the interdisciplinary lens of human geography and urban planning, these contextual examples will reflect the diverse place-based practices, processes, problems and possibilities of life in contemporary societies.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.

This course examines themes, concepts, theories, and trends which define the study of international development from a critical geographical perspective. Students will gain an understanding of the historical and contemporary challenges of global inequality with reference to specific case studies. We shall be discussing what Development means by examining different development pathways and strategies throughout the global economy. While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems.
