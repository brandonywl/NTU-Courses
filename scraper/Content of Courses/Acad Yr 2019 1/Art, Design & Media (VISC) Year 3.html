In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in Art History and Theory. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their relevance to Art History and Theory in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire key critical skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and new insights.
Finally, you will present your responses, in the form of a written paper and oral presentations.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the questions and issues it provokes. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Paper.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

This course is designed for students who?ve already taken foundational Art History courses and chronologically follows DD3005 Survey of Modern Art 1900-1945. In this course you will be introduced to the moment of transformation from modern to contemporary art. It?s intended as a historical and conceptual framework for the development of critical thinking and visual analysis regarding today?s art practice. You will be introduced to a series of art forms and ideas, which still pervade the contemporary, 21st century global art world. You will examine the cultural and socio- political contexts through which these art forms and ways of thinking emerged. The analysis of these artistic contexts is essential for the understanding of a number of parallel situations in contemporary Southeast Asian art and will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on the contemporary.

This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

This is an introductory course that will introduce you to the fundamental concepts shared by all core programming languages. The core structure and foundations of common programming languages will be explored in a theoretical and practical manner as well as demonstrating that sometimes vastly different applications such as games, websites and installations are based on similar logical and structural principles. By the end of the course, you will be able to write basic games, and create interactive environments. This will allow you to create digital systems and artwork individually or collectively in future practice.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

You will be introduced to the storyboard as a thinking tool, through which creative ideas are developed and given detail. You will learn to employ artistic tools like framing, camera movement, character movement and key visuals within the larger structure of the entire narrative. The role of the storyboard within the animation pipeline and its relevance to concept development, script development, animatics and production design will be covered. The course will focus partucularly focus on the aspects of animation production design that support the dramatic impact of the story. Further insight will be gained of the connection between visual development and storyboard through exercises and assignments on character design, environment and prop design.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.
