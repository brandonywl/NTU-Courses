This course introduces students to sociological theories, methods, and research through an examination of selected social problems in a global context.  "Social problems" refers to sets of social conditions, arrangements, and practices whose resolution, or mere existence, social actors deem important. "Social problems" are social in two ways. First, social problems are constituted through human interaction. Second, social problems are socially defined and thus the meaning and significance of social problems may be contested. There are some social problems that pose practical (if different) challenges for us all. This course introduces sociological perspectives on social problems relating to poverty and inequality, work and occupations, social welfare, and the constitution and role of government.

This course examines the theoretical foundations of sociology as a discipline. It focuses on the key ideas and perspectives developed by classical social theorists in their analyses of basic features of social life, the making of modern society and the consequences of modernity. In particular, the contributions of major thinkers such as Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber are discussed against the backdrop of the social and intellectual contexts of their times. In understanding the pivotal influence of such contributions on the development of the discipline, the subject also considers their continuing relevance for analysing social change in the contemporary world.

Large -scale and complex organisations are a central feature of modern society. This course examines theories and types of organisations, especially in terms of hierarchy, control, authority, decision -making and accountability. In particular, it considers the rise and impact of bureaucracy and bureaucratic rationality in modern society and the subsequent development of schools or systems of management. In understanding the formal features of bureaucratic and post -bureaucratic organizations, the course also considers the informal, cultural and small -group processes that influence the functioning of organisations. Organisational change  and the transformation of management in contemporary society  is analysed in terms of the relations between organisations and their environments.

This course is designed to introduce contemporary forms of migration and their implications for living within diverse and multicultural societies through sociological concepts and key perspectives.  This course will give students a broad understanding of the central issues associated with migration and settlement, with an attempt to focus on south-south migrations and generate conversation with more commonly studied South to North movements of people. The first half of the course will address various types of migration and key transnational framings of the movements of people across domestic and international boundaries. In the second half, the ways in which various states deal with the diversity of their temporary and more permanent immigrant populations will be explored. This is done using a case study approach that allows for a deeper understanding of each site. Finally, the course introduces some elements of everyday migrant life in order to provide a balance to highly state-centric readings of migration. The course seeks to link issues of migration with understandings of contemporary multiculturalism so that they can be examined as interrelated transnational phenomena. In these discussions, class and ethnicity emerge as key vectors of differentiation and analysis.

This course builds upon the foundations laid by classical social theory and maps out the field of contemporary social theory. In particular, the legacy of classical theory is critically reviewed in light of the advent of the "postindustrial", "postmodern" and "post-Cold War" era in the late twentieth-century and the early twenty-first century. Beyond surveying the ideas and perspectives that major social theorists have developed in response to the transformation of contemporary society, the subject focuses on key contributions that have influenced the development of sociology in recent decades.

Social statistics appear routinely not just in articles in academic journals but also those in newspapers and popular magazines. Statistics are often cited and accepted as "factual" evidence or "empirical" support for a particular opinion or policy. But statistics can be used and abused. This course aims to develop a working understanding of social statistics, focusing on basic statistical concepts, the logic of statistical reasoning in social research, the foundations of statistical inference and hypothesis testing, and the generation and interpretation of statistical data. Students also learn to use a statistical software package for social research.

Why are some countries poorer than others, and why do some countries develop faster than others? 'Development' is often equated with 'industrialization', 'modernisation' and other such large-scale social transformations. That conventional approach assumes that all societies advance through linear, evolutionary stages of 'progress' through the adoption of modernizing institutions and practices. In studying the historical experience of developing countries (in Africa, Latin America and Asia), this subject views development and social change through the lens of political, economic and cultural processes, recognizing that outcomes of 'development' often hinge on competing ideas, conflicting interests, and power asymmetries. Students will gain a historically grounded understanding of development and social change in a variety of institutional settings.

HY0001 will introduce students to three major ethical theories' utilitarianism, Kant's deontology, and virtue ethics. Then, four weeks will be devoted to teaching the ethical principles underlying academic integrity, research ethics, and intellectual property. Finally, students will discuss issues related to the ethics of environmental sustainability and conservation. All the while, students will be challenged apply the ethical theories learned to concrete moral problems, including world poverty, corporate accountability and whistleblowing, and workplace discrimination.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
