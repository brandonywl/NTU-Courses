This course introduces basics of media law, ethics, and policy, emphasizing Singapore's unique approach.  Objectives are:
	To develop working knowledge of the law in Singapore-to train you to recognize potential trouble, to know when you're safe, and give you practice in defending your decisions.
	To examine the development of the Singapore's media law and its underlying policy rationales, and compare and contrast different approaches to media law internationally.  
	To examine the role of media ethics standards, as supplements or alternatives to regulation.  In the ethics section, we also think about what kind of professional standards we want to uphold in our careers.

To better understand how and why communication occurs and what effects it has, it is necessary to get inside the "black box" of the human mind. Therefore, this course will concentrate on studying cognitive processes and their relationship to media and communication. While some attention will be paid to the psychological aspects of interpersonal communication, the primary the goal of the course is to develop an understanding of media from a psychological perspective. That is, the course will examine how perception, attention, memory, attitudes and emotion are related to the experience of mediated communication. These psychological responses will be examined in a range of contexts and communication functions including news and information, advertising and persuasion, and entertainment. This will help students become both better producers of media and more critical users.

This course will introduce the theoretical foundation of cutting-edge data analytic techniques and its applications to communication research, focusing on Bayesian statistics. Its theoretical part will cover the philosophical discourses over empirical research, basic probability theory, the logic of hypothesis testing, and statistical inference and learning from data. Two special topics include the applications of Bayesian statistics to machine learning techniques. An equal weight of emphasis will be placed on developing practical skills for collecting and analysing data to solve real-world problems. Students will learn computational programming languages, such as R and Python, through a series of tutorials, lab assignments, and final projects. The well-balanced combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills offered in this course will provide qualification requirements both for professional analysts in media industry and for academic researchers in communication studies and other social sciences.

A network is a collection of nodes that are connected in pairs by edges, which is the most powerful way of representing complex and dynamic systems like human societies. People, artifacts, events, and anything else around us can be viewed as nodes, and their interactions as edges. Friendship, love, ideas, information, money, power, or even disease pass through and are shaped by networks, and therefore, can be formulated and examined from a network perspective. This course will introduce the core concepts of network analysis and their applications to real- world problems. Its theoretical part will cover the fundamental theory of network analysis and review related works on social and communication networks. An equal weight of emphasis will be placed on developing practical skills for collecting and analyzing data to investigate empirical networks using computational programming languages, such as R and Python.

This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

This course will provide an introductory overview to the field of biological psychology.  Course content will begin by explaining what biological psychology is and why biology is the ultimate basis for the expression of behavior in any living organism. The course will cover the anatomy of the nervous system by exploring the structures of the brain, spine and neurons, and will introduce the basic techniques used by biopsychologists. In addition, the biological foundations of the perceptual and sensorimotor systems will be covered.  The course will also cover the plasticity of the brain and how damage to the brain can influence behavior. We will cover material on the biological basis of motivation, cognition and emotion. We will study how hormones influence behavior, and we will cover the biology of sleep. Lastly, the course will introduce pharmacology, and the neurology of stress and psychological disorders.

Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. You will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage you to critically evaluate  and  write about  issues  from  multiple  perspectives  before you develop your  own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as you go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
