HE4001 is an advanced microeconomic course in the undergraduate level. It aims at laying down a solid foundation for students in their future graduate studies or in their future research work in the field of economics. Students enrolling this course are expected to have taken an intermediate level microeconomic course such as HE2001 and have some basic analytical skills.

In this course, we adopt the overlapping-generations model as the dynamic model to model the macro economy, and use a consistent approach based on microeconomic foundations and the rationality of economic agents to address several issues in monetary policy, exchange-rate policy and fiscal policy. Among other issues, the issues in monetary policy studied here include the welfare effects of an increasing stock of fiat money, the development of financial intermediaries in the presence of differences in the rates of return between illiquid capital and money, and the reasons for the observed correlation between the nominal money stock and real output. The issues in exchange-rate policy studied here include the implications of different international monetary systems, the determination of exchange rates in the presence of currency controls and the indeterminacy of exchange rates when people are free to hold currencies of their choice.

The Solow Growth Model and the Ramsey Growth Model will be presented, followed by variations and extensions with product variety, product quality, technology diffusion, and human capital. Selected topics on income inequality, social mobility, institution, natural resources, unemployment, migration, finance, and others in relation to growth theory will be examined. Recent empirical studies on economic growth will be discussed and assessed.

The topics include economic development, monetary and fiscal policies, exchange rate, market liberalization, manpower and labor market, social security, international trade and regional co-operation. The objective is to provide final year economics undergraduates with greater insights into the policies that have shaped Singapore?s economic growth and to engage students in an evaluation of these policies and development experiences. It will be unique in drawing upon the expertise of adjunct staff members who have been involved in policy-making, staff members who have worked extensively in the area, and senior government policy- and decision-makers.

The module will be conducted seminar-style. Class room participation will constitute 50 percent and written examination 50 percent.

Personnel Economics is the application of economic and mathematical approaches and econometric and statistical methods to traditional topics in the study of human resources management. Compared to the standard labor economics courses, this course focuses more on the internal labor market within firms. This includes topics such as compensation, turnover, incentives, and compensation that are inherently economic, as well as those that do not at first appear to be economic topics, such as norms, teamwork, worker empowerment, and peer relationships. It has become a rapid developing research field since its birth and, as a course, has been taught in many top universities and MBA programs. The current course is a general introduction to this emerging field of researches and the human resource management in practice. We analyze the efficient allocation and motivation of employees as well as their development of skills within a company. We discuss recruiting mechanisms, training strategies and efficient compensation schemes. The course also has a focus on recent empirical evidences within the field of personnel economics.

This course provides an introduction to econometric time series techniques that are widely used in analyzing economic data. The course will meet the needs of students who plan more advanced studies in this area. Students are instructed on the econometric time series techniques that can be used for empirical economic studies, as well as to analyze financial time series. Topics covered include stationary time-series models, trends and volatility modeling, models for time-varying volatility, univariate processes with unit roots, multiequation time-series models, cointegration and the error-correction models.

In today's competitive world, it is essential that students learn the crucial career skills early to ensure a competitive edge sharpened with a heightened sense of workplace values and ethics.  This course takes students through a journey of career discovery, understanding and polishing of oneself which will then be translated into job application tools such as resumes and interview skills. 

All students will have the opportunity to undergo a robust Career Assessment Tool, which assesses their career options and career self and helps them chart a career action plan. They will also learn how to identify and articulate the concept of personal branding and applying that to resumes and interviews and online social media. Students will also be exposed to the basics of grooming to ensure that they are aware of the importance of first impressions in all situations.
