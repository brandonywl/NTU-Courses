This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students who have never been exposed to political science studies to the fundamentals of the discipline. In so doing, students in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme (major & minor) will acquire the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical tools that would allow them to think seriously about politics. The ultimate goal is to equip students with essential political ideas and principles and enable them to apply these concepts to studying contemporary political life.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. You will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage you to critically evaluate  and  write about  issues  from  multiple  perspectives  before you develop your  own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as you go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus.
