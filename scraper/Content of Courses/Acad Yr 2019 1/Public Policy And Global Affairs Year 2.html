This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

Since the early 1990s, the Internet has been viewed as an increasingly essential tool to improve public sector performance, stimulate economic growth and facilitate better governance. Many governments worldwide have invested heavily in e-government implementation in order to realize the transformative potential of e-government. In the context of a changing world, the challenges facing governments have increased. Governments are under mounting pressure to strengthen their governing capacities and foster future growth and stability. In an era of crisis and uncertainty, the study of e-government has become more necessary and important than ever before. 

The aims of this course are to enable students to gain both theoretical and empirical knowledge of e-government, and to equip students with critical thinking and problem solving skills to examine key issues in e-government.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
