HY0001 will introduce students to three major ethical theories' utilitarianism, Kant's deontology, and virtue ethics. Then, four weeks will be devoted to teaching the ethical principles underlying academic integrity, research ethics, and intellectual property. Finally, students will discuss issues related to the ethics of environmental sustainability and conservation. All the while, students will be challenged apply the ethical theories learned to concrete moral problems, including world poverty, corporate accountability and whistleblowing, and workplace discrimination.

Most introductory courses or books in QM start off with special systems (for example infinite square well) and derive its wave function in position representation from the Schrodinger?s equation. Although this approach may be intuitive due to its physical setup, it tends to give the wrong impression that wave functions are fundamental objects in QM. In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation.
 
This course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly.  You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. 
 
Part 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. The concept of measurement will also be covered. This provides probabilistic results for experiments.
 
Part 2 aims to discuss symmetry within QM. Rotational symmetry (angular momentum is the generator of rotations) is the main and very important example. The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM.
 
Part 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly. These are real-life QM examples and the standard method to solve these systems is via perturbation for time-independent/dependent and non-degenerate/degenerate systems.

This course is a survey of particle physics for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students. It explores the common roots and tools of the nuclear (medium energy) and particle (high energy) fields. The main objective is to develop an understanding of the Standard Model of quarks, leptons and the fundamental interactions of the universe together with the associated experimental techniques.
Specific topics include an introduction to the fundamental interactions and their mediators, quarks and leptons, symmetries and tests of conservation laws, and indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. The course in particular includes experimental techniques in particle physics, including the physics principles of particle accelerators and particle detectors. The lectures on particle accelerators will include selected topics in the types of accelerators, transverse & longitudinal dynamics, the lattice, magnets, RF and plasma acceleration, as well as electron dynamics & synchrotron radiation. The particle detector lectures will include a presentation of the main properties of particle interactions with matter, which form the basis of all particle detectors. The various types of detectors used in particle physics experiments are discussed in detail, including their sensitivity, detector response, energy, space and time resolution response functions, detector efficiency and dead time, covering devices for position and momentum measurements, particle identification systems, calorimeters and multipurpose systems, as well as the overall design of a particle physics experiment. Current and future experimental challenges will be discussed for modern particle physics experiments, including the data volume and computing challenge, the online collision selection, and the data analyses - taking the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at CERN as an example.  . 
The application of such accelerators and detectors, for example in the medical and industrial sectors, will be discussed as well.
