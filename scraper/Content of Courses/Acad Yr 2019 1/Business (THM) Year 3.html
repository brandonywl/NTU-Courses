With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces the building blocks of negotiation.   Through an active and experiential learning approach, you will not only learn about the theoretical elements of negotiation but have opportunity to put theory into practice every week.    By the end of the course you will have a framework which you will be able to use to prepare for all your future negotiations.   You will get as much out of the course as you put in - through your effort in preparing for the exercises and immersion in the negotiation simulations.

"Services represent the fastest growing sector of any developed economy. In the United States, this sector is responsible for nearly 75% of GDP and 80% of employment. Similarly, 75% of GDP and 70% of jobs in Singapore are generated by services. This trend persists in other industrialized nations. Moreover, these figures under-represent the actual role and significance of services in the economy because many manufacturing firms are increasingly involved in service-type jobs such as design, distribution, financial planning, customization, and after-sales services. That said, it is important for any manager (or student of management) to understand how services differ from manufacturing operations, and how toefficiently and effectively manage service operations.

In the first 7 weeks of the course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for designing, managing, analyzing, and improving service operations. Students will also learn to use analytical models and decision support tools for improving the operational effectiveness and efficiency in service organizations. Topics covered include Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Quality, Process Management, Project Management, Forecasting, Queue Management, Workforce Scheduling, and Capacity & Demand Management. 

The remaining weeks will focus on understanding the basics of service operations in the hospitality industry. Specific topics such as Front Office Management, F&B Management, Housekeeping, Facility Maintenance, and Revenue Management will be covered in this segment.

The goals of the course are:
1.   to provide an understanding and appreciation of the service functions of firms related to the
      Hospitality and Tourism industry,
2.   to understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to succeed in
      designing and managing service operations. The teaching method used is seminar style
      with a mix of lectures, in-class problem solving, discussions, video showing, and facility
      tours."
