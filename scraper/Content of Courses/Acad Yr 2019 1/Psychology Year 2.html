Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?
