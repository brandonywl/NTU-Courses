This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

Cinema, like all cultural products, is political in some way or other.  By deploying race, gender, and class as critical categories of reading film, this course's approach seeks to examine the political and ideological implications and assumptions of film art as a popular cultural medium.  Brief introductions to theories on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ideology, and class will provide the framework for the viewing of classic and contemporary film from different cinematic cultures.

We will begin with Plato's Symposium, and move on to recent theorizations and philosophies of love.  More than simply addressing thematic concerns, this course will approach love as a philosophy and a discursive practice, as well as address the issues of subjectivity, the Self-Other relation and difference, all of which are central to love. Our final aim is to evaluate the potential for love to serve as a discourse of alterity.  We will be covering a variety of discourses and texts: philosophy, psychoanalysis, feminism and literary theory; film and literary works by both male and female authors and poets.

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of' - and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

Designed for students interested in evolutionary theory and how it is applied to psychology, this course aims to explore how human behavior and our minds have adaptive function. You will learn the basics of evolutionary theory, the concept of adaptation, and the problems of variation. The course will cover methods of applying evolutionary theory to psychology, going through evolutionary accounts of human behavior, sociality, development, cognition, and mental illness. The course applies to students seeking stronger theoretical background in psychology, supporting careers in both application and research of psychology.

This introductory course explores what it means to develop the 'sociological imagination'.  Moving beyond an understanding of the biological basis of behaviour, the course develops a perspective of the human person located in 'society' - within webs of social relationships and institutional forms of social organisation.  Social life is governed by norms and constraints, but individuals as social actors also 'make history' and exercise choice in their lives.  In addition, the course develops a comparative understanding of the diversity of societal forms and cultural traditions in human history, especially the key features of modern life and its continued transformation in contemporary times.

This course introduces students to sociological theories, methods, and research through an examination of selected social problems in a global context.  "Social problems" refers to sets of social conditions, arrangements, and practices whose resolution, or mere existence, social actors deem important. "Social problems" are social in two ways. First, social problems are constituted through human interaction. Second, social problems are socially defined and thus the meaning and significance of social problems may be contested. There are some social problems that pose practical (if different) challenges for us all. This course introduces sociological perspectives on social problems relating to poverty and inequality, work and occupations, social welfare, and the constitution and role of government.

This course examines the theoretical foundations of sociology as a discipline. It focuses on the key ideas and perspectives developed by classical social theorists in their analyses of basic features of social life, the making of modern society and the consequences of modernity. In particular, the contributions of major thinkers such as Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber are discussed against the backdrop of the social and intellectual contexts of their times. In understanding the pivotal influence of such contributions on the development of the discipline, the subject also considers their continuing relevance for analysing social change in the contemporary world.

'Globalization' refers to the increasing interaction and interdependence between peoples and places across the world. This course examines the interrelated cultural, economic and political processes that constitute globalization, and analyses their impact on individuals, groups, cities and nation-states. Emphasis is placed on understanding the multifaceted character of globalization and the debates that it has engendered. Specific themes include the spread of global capitalism, the global consequences of technological advancements in transport and communications (especially the Internet), the expansion of consumer culture, issues of global governance, and new cultural formations.

What's proper reasoning and how do you tell whether an argument is good or bad? This class introduces you to formal logic, a set of powerful tools that allow us to give precise answers to the preceding questions. Along the way we will also discuss a few paradoxes - for example, how should we understand and evaluate claims about objects that don't exist, such as the claim that Santa Clause lives on the North Pole?

This course is an introduction to contemporary political philosophy. States claim to have a monopoly on the justified use of coercive force. This is a stunning, and perhaps alarming, claim. It's all the more stunning once we recognize that this power is wielded, not merely over non- human animals or children, but over competent adults. Accordingly, the fundamental question of contemporary political philosophy is this: How is authority - i.e., the power to create moral obligations in others by means of commands -possible among free and equal moral persons? Anarchists think this question does not admit of a plausible answer. In this class, we'll see if they're right.

In this course, you will learn about various theories of the moral justification of state power.  You will critically evaluate arguments for and against these theories. Finally, you will be trained to write essays in which you argue for your own views about whether and how states can be morally justified in wielding coercive force.

The course proceeds historically, and will consider various philosophical proposals and approaches to understanding human subjectivity, experience, and meaning. It begins with 19th century proposals, of a theistic and non-theistic nature, and then considers 20th century approaches, focused on phenomenological versions of existentialism.

Through close readings of influential existentialist texts, we will evaluate their persuasiveness and implications for our lives. The following questions, among others, will be of particular interest: Does experience have any (determinate) meaning? What is the nature of value? What can I hope for? Should I fear death? Am I free? What obligations do I have to myself and to others?

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

This historical introduction focuses on central concepts of 19th century European philosophy, many of which have profoundly shaped our current philosophical, political, and cultural landscape.

The course proceeds historically. With a keen eye on each thinker's responses to their predecessors, we will attempt to understand Fichte's modification of key Kantian claims, Hegel's dialectic and speculative phenomenology, Marx's historical materialism, Kierkegaard's philosophical conception of faith, and Nietzsche's genealogical method.

Topics to be considered include the nature and ground of human cognition; the philosophical significance of history; the relationship of knowledge and reason to history and social facts; the nature of faith and its relation to reason, responsibility, and human identity; the origin and meaning of moral claims; the 'hermeneutic' nature of human experience and consciousness; and others.

The aim of this class is to introduce you to some of the major recent developments in contemporary epistemology, including various ways in which formal methods have been used to study philosophical problems. We will discuss both debates that are internal to contemporary approaches in epistemology as well as contrasts between modern and traditional approached to epistemology. We will also discuss applications of modern epistemology in, for example, a legal context.

Philosophy is done in different ways. In supporting their claims, different philosophers take very different approaches and cite different sources of information. This course is an introduction to metaphiloso ph y- the philosophical assessment of philosophy itself. It addresses the question of whether some ways of doing philosophy-Le., some philosophical methodologies-are more reliable than others in leading to discovery. This question is fundamental to the enterprise of philosophy: it calls for us to reflect whether philosophical questions can have correct answers, and whether philosophical reflection can yield knowledge of interesting truths. We will survey different methodologies pursued across multiple areas of philosophy, including epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and ethics. Along the way, we will identify standards of success for philosophical arguments, and we will ask whether any ways of doing philosophy are particularly effective in facilitating successful philosophy.

Effective altruism (EA) is a philosophical and social movement guided by the simple yet powerful idea that we should use our resources (money, time, etc.) to do the most good that we can.  This course explores a variety of theoretical and practical issues surrounding EA, including its philosophical foundations, its application to major choices we make in our lives, and notable criticisms that it faces.  Examples of more specific topics we?ll cover include how morally demanding EA should be, whether EA is compatible with moral frameworks other than utilitarianism, and criticisms (and possible improvements) of its conception of effective intervention.
