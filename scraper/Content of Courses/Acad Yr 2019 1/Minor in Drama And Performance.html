This course will introduce to students the fundamental principles of theatre and performance making as well as performance analysis. It examines how theatre is developed from a range of sources, and explores ways in which scripted text is transformed, interpreted and manipulated. Working with the body, voice and performance space as critical performance elements, a number of 20th century theatre-making methodologies will be explored and examined. These include the theories and practice of Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht. Where practice approaches are concerned, there will be a particular focus on Realist (Stanislavsky) and Epic (Brecht) dramaturgical and performance strategies. In addition, the course will also introduce two modes of performance analysis, semiotics and phenomenology, and other ways to `de-code' performances.

1	Defining Theatre, Drama and Performance. The Text-Performance Dialectic
2	Analysing Performance: Semiotics 
3	Analysing Performance: Phenomenology
4	Naturalism and Realist Theatre: Konstantin Stanislavski and Realist Acting
5	Epic Theatre: Bertolt Brecht and Brechtian Acting
6	Technical Theatre

This course examines what it means to act in theatre and explores the processes of personal preparation for the task of acting on stage, through working towards an understanding of the Actor's Voice and Body. It provides opportunities for students to engage in thinking through experiencing representational (realist) and presentational (non-realist) modes of performance. It also develops an understanding of fundamental principles that are involved in acting in an ensemble and individually. The course emphasises personal commitment to and ownership of the process, requiring participants to actively contribute to improvisations and discussions, rehearsals and performances with a strong intent to build on skills and improve on an overall understanding of theatre and live acting.

In this course students will work both individually and in small groups as they examine playwriting processes, script analysis and drama conventions. They will consider the role of the sole and collaborative playwright through writing exercises, improvisational and play-building techniques and research. Participants will examine some playwrights' methodologies and analyse a range of scripts that have been published as texts and used in performance. They read, watch and/or critique works by local playwrights as well international ones. A range of writing processes will be explored, leading to a variety of end-products ? for example, from scene-work to the development of treatment for multi-media performance; from dramaturgical and/or critical approaches to script analysis to the development of short playscripts. Participants will consider the place of playwriting in the broader context, including theatre in the community, drama education and theatre for special purposes.

1	Approaches to Script analysis and Close Reading of Plays
2	Developing Frame and Purpose in Playwriting
3	Structuring Plot and Situation in Story Development
4	Building Character and Shaping Relationships
5	Developing Dialogue and Critical Nuances 
6	Apprehending and Engaging with Key Themes and Contextually Relevant Issues 
7	Analysing Dialogue and Evaluating Aesthetic Value
8	Engaging with Rehearsal Process for Rehearsed Reading

This course engages students in learning and analysing the skills and capacities of a director and dramaturg in relation to theatre-making. It explores the practices and philosophies that underpin the work of directing and dramaturgy as critical aspects of performance and production. Students will examine how directing is informed by particular aims and objectives, ideologies and aesthetics that engage the director, and develop dramaturgical approaches to researching, critiquing and questioning how these frameworks can be concretised and advanced. 

Attendance is compulsory and failure to comply with minimum attendance can result in failure.
