This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

War, as a quintessential part of social existence, attracts scholarship from the humanities and social sciences on issues directly or indirectly related to military conflict. Students of history are not exempt from this study as they conduct research on topics ranging from the military conflicts themselves to their long term impacts. However, the theories behind the actions taken during military conflicts remain a field of study of a niche group of military professionals and strategy researchers only. This situation creates a gap in the theoretical understanding of these military conflicts outside of this niche group.
 
This courses seeks to close this theoretical gap and to explain the theories of modern military conflict from the Napoleonic era to contemporary, through the medium of war movies.  Using some of the 20th and 21st century's most iconic war films as a tool will aid student understanding in translating these often complex and abstract theories into practical applications.
