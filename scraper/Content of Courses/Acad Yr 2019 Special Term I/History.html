War, as a quintessential part of social existence, attracts scholarship from the humanities and social sciences on issues directly or indirectly related to military conflict. Students of history are not exempt from this study as they conduct research on topics ranging from the military conflicts themselves to their long term impacts. However, the theories behind the actions taken during military conflicts remain a field of study of a niche group of military professionals and strategy researchers only. This situation creates a gap in the theoretical understanding of these military conflicts outside of this niche group.
 
This courses seeks to close this theoretical gap and to explain the theories of modern military conflict from the Napoleonic era to contemporary, through the medium of war movies.  Using some of the 20th and 21st century's most iconic war films as a tool will aid student understanding in translating these often complex and abstract theories into practical applications.
