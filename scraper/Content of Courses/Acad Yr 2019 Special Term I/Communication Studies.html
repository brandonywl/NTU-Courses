This course examines major theoretical perspectives and concepts relevant to interpersonal communication in personal relationships. These relationships include the everyday associations we have with others as a result of the positions we occupy in various situations, as well as the more intimate relationships we form with select others (friendships, family relationships, and sexual relationships). The knowledge gained from this class will help students better understand themselves and their relationships with people around them.

The focus of this course is on the creation, production, performance, and dissemination of various forms of publicity to support a range of comprehensive communication campaigns. It covers print and audiovisual media and the activities of government and non-profit organisations as well as private corporations.  The course is organised around a client project.  The proposed campaign will require that students to do some basic consumer research, develop a positioning strategy, create original advertising and other marketing communication materials, develop a media plan, and put all of these elements into a written plan and presentation for the client as if they were "pitching" for an account.
