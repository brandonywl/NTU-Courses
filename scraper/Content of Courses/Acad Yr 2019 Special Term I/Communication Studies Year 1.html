This course examines major theoretical perspectives and concepts relevant to interpersonal communication in personal relationships. These relationships include the everyday associations we have with others as a result of the positions we occupy in various situations, as well as the more intimate relationships we form with select others (friendships, family relationships, and sexual relationships). The knowledge gained from this class will help students better understand themselves and their relationships with people around them.
