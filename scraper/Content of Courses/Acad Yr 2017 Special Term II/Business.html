The objective of this course is to expose non-accounting and non-business students to the environment of accounting and its role in providing information for useful decision making by various stakeholders of business organizations. By the end of the course, students should be able to appreciate the role, scope and value of information for managing business organizations towards achieving their goals.

Students will learn fundamental concepts and techniques in financial and managerial accounting through solving business problems. In this course, students are treated to an understanding of a broad range of the underlying accounting concepts without the need to be involved in too much detail associated with the processes. Whilst non-accounting and non-business students need not have to prepare detailed financial statements, it would be beneficial for them to be able to understand, interpret, analyze and use them.

Topics covered include - the role of accounting in business; the accounting cycle; understanding, interpretation and analysis of financial statements; and the application of accounting tools for strategic planning and control in a business organization.

This is an introductory course in finance for non-business and non-accounting students, which provides students with a broad understanding of the principles and practice of Business Finance/Financial Management.   The emphasis is on the major financial decisions made by companies and the valuation of investments made by them.  The course starts by examining the various forms of businesses and the importance of interest rates.  Time value of money, and the linkage between risk and return, lays the foundation for evaluating the price of bonds and stocks.  Students will learn and apply principles of capital budgeting (calculating the profitability of various projects and deciding which one to proceed) and capital structure (financing approved projects by issuing shares or bonds, or using retained earnings).  The decision to use extra cash to pay dividends or repurchase shares will be analysed and the course concludes with the use of derivatives to protect and enhance the value of firms.

Students intending to take this course should be numerate (good and comfortable with mathematical calculations and formulas) e.g. they should know well compound interest calculations, Sum of Geometric Progression (G.P.) calculation before attending this course.

To function in an organisation, technical skills by themselves are insufficient; they have to be supplemented by management training.  Success in an organisation depends as much on general management skills and understanding operational systems as on technical expertise.  Hence, students need a firm foundation in management skills.  This course is designed for non-business students and aims to equip them with the knowledge, skills and competence in various aspects of management, including: the role of management and managers; decision-making, planning and strategy; managing organisational architecture; managing individuals and groups; and controlling critical organisational processes.

We live in a global world, where a premium is placed on the ability to navigate and adapt to differences. Cultural intelligence, CQ is the capability to function effectively across national, ethnic and organizational, organizational cultures (Ang & Van Dyne). IQ and EQ are no longer enough, CQ is becoming a critical predictor for success in the borderless world of the 21st century. The good news is that CQ can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. This course will focus on providing students a conceptual framework for CQ, as well as a set of tools to navigate and explore the world.

At the end of the course, students can expect the following outcomes:-
(1)	A greater understanding of their own motivation, culture, values, and personality, as well
         as their CQ strengths and weaknesses (CQ Motivation & Strategy) 

(2)	Knowledge and experience of how cultures differ in values and behaviours, and how to
         capitalize on similarities, and leverage on the differences (CQ Knowledge);
 
(3)	Enhanced awareness and efficacy of your own communication style in cross cultural
         contexts (CQ Behaviour)

Teaching Method: 

Highly experiential and focused on learning from own self-reflection, class activities and group work, this course focuses on bringing conceptual knowledge to life.
