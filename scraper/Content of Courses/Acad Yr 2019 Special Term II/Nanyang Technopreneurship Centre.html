The start-up and growth of an enterprise invariably involves both human and financial capital. To manage the increasing pool of human resources and to convince venture capitalists to invest become two main issues especially for growing ventures. 

This module consists of two parts: in the first part, organization and human resource management are introduced; in the second part, the focus is on writing a convincing business plan to attract venture capital investment.

This course aims to provide students a holistic approach towards the management of a company, from start-up phase to growth & expansion, where you would understand and learn to recognise and analyse an organisation as an integrated entity in achieving the company's objectives and strategies. In deliberating and executing some of the major business decisions that entrepreneurs face when growing their ventures and competing with other companies in the same industry, you will broaden and deepen your analytical skills when assessing the correlational impact across the organisation instead of viewing each functional activity as a standalone.
Through the use of a business simulator software platform, you will be immersed in and experience the process of managing a business. You will form groups with your peers to compete with one another. As you work through the organization's life cycle in the simulation, external forces and real-world managerial dilemmas are added to test your responsiveness and abilities to deal with uncertainties.
