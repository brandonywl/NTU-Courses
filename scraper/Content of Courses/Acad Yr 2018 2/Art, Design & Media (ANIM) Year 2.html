Working from observation
In this course you will consistently work from observation in order to hone your eye and become more sensitive to the dimensional world around you. You will learn to perceive proportion both intuitively and also through measuring. You will explore concepts of composition, line work, shape design, value structure, and colour, in order to translate your ideas and perceptions into a finished drawing or sequence.

Investigating and experimenting with materials
You will be continually compelled to challenge yourself with new techniques and materials. From pen and ink, to charcoal to watercolour, this course will serve as an introduction to many new materials and processes

Finding personal aesthetic
You will continually work toward developing your pictorial goals. You will be asked to first define your specific aesthetic goals including composition, line work, lighting effects etc., and then chart a course for improving towards those goals

Integrating sketching into a creative workflow
In this class you will be encouraged to make free standing drawings that function as independent art pieces, and also to utilise drawing as a primary step in ideation.  By utilising observational as well as reference drawing, you will develop a process by which to create well informed and well observed drawings.

The course is conducted in a studio/classroom or at a site-specific place corresponding to the assignment. The instructor and students observe the progress of everyone's work, and contribute critique as it is being made. Learning is a collective experience in the classroom, and you will problem-solve on the canvas, benefitting from a cross-pollination of ideas and input from your peers. It is therefore very important that you attend all classes. 

The semester begins with representational painting using slow-drying, indirect oil painting techniques learning basic paint mixing, colour observation and composition. Gradually you will become more independent with your work. The semester ends with experimentation of modernist direct application of wet-in-wet acrylic paint. 

The course also offers opportunities to collaborate with local museum exhibitions as well as international students, artists and communities.

This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.

Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in film practice. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their immediate relevance to film practice in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire any necessary skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and possible solution.

Finally, you will present your response, describing your analysis, strategy, process, which will move toward your proposed film project.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the response. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Project Presentation and handin.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

Semiotics of Interactive Media:
Discussions on meaning of action and participation(input) in relationship with the audio-visual system responses (output) in interactive media projects. Identifying and comparison of processing as another core element with other two(input, output).

Designing interactions and role of prototyping:
Identifying and developing conceptual frameworks for an interactive media project. The importance of the development and design of a project prototype. You will prototype ideas in order to experience your interaction designs before they go to the production stage.

Developing and producing interactive projects:
Identifying and project development through the following stages of interactive media production (in chronological order): development of a project demo, adjustment of the project goals and outcomes, production, postproduction. 

Class assignments:
One core interactive media project that enables students to identify the following parts of an interactive media project: input, processing and output. The medium of project can be, but it is not limited to: interactive object, screen, website, game, projection, performance, soundscape, etc. Developed through self-directed learning with guidance, assisted with lectures, tutorials, class exercises, and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in interactive media. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their immediate relevance for interactivity in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research - to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire any necessary skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and possible solution.

Finally, you will present your response, describing your analysis, strategy, design process, and your proposed solution.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the design response. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments:
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Project Presentation and handin.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

This course focuses on connecting the worlds of objects, experiences and meanings through a conceptual framework. It introduces the student to the importance of juxtaposing new and contradictory design situations with the task of understanding and resolving them. Subjects are examined through a conceptual lens: studying different aspects of semantics, imagery, perception, behaviour, beliefs, culture as structural frameworks in the development of ideas. Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.

Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process:
The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.

Design as Discourse/ Critical Design:
You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

Conceptual Design projects:
You will apply conceptual and critical design methods to realize design projects based on various themes.

The surface design of an object is an integral part of the object itself. It can be decorated in such a way that key aspects of the object?s function are encoded or it may serve only to present an engaging aesthetic. It may be a thing that has been applied onto the surface or it may be integral to the material and the object itself. Surface Design is a studio course. Students will learn how to apply designs onto a wide range of surfaces and materials using a range of techniques. Students will be introduced to surface design through projects involving the researching of visual sources, idea development through drawing and colour sketches and final output.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

This course is a practical course that focuses on learning techniques and processes of digital image manipulation. The course begins with essential processes, applied in specific scenarios to achieve certain outcomes. As skills increase, the course will cover multiple image combining, a process known as compositing, heavily used in many areas of digital media such as animation, special effects, motion graphics and film-making. Finally, you will be introduced to digital painting and digital art, where the imagery is created within the digital medium. For a final project, you will create an original, unique digital image using all the learned skills, either composited, or painted using digital painting techniques.

In this advanced course, we are aiming to encourage the students to be creative within a given framework. The course is interdisciplinary in nature and students will have to collaborate. They will be asked to organize themselves in small groups, where each individual will use skills from different disciplines to achieve the common goal: modeling, texturing, rigging and lighting skills will be necessary. The course will be open to students from other areas as well and aims to be interdisciplinary in nature. In the first part of the course, the students will learn new tools and prepare the assets for the second, more practically oriented part. In this second half of the course, they will practically integrate all those elements in one cohesive short sequence.

Pattern Classification:
Introduction to pattern terminology (repetition, element, motifs and meta motifs) and pattern classification (decorative, conversational, figurative, abstract, and geometric).

Designing Pattern Collection:  
Part 1: The overview of essential methods of illustration for pattern motifs such as sketching, collecting of inspirational visual reference and translating gathered materials into mood-board. 
Part 2: Introduction to the essential tools used in working further from sketches for development of finished motifs, such as translating drawn elements into a single motif and into meta-motifs, digital tracing, layering, adding custom color palette and texture. 

Designing a Seamless Repeating Pattern:
An exploration of strategies to construct a variety of seamless repeat pattern variations and a simple and complex design composed of one or more motifs, multiplied and arranged in orderly sequence. Explained and practiced concepts and the construction principles of each pattern type, as well as the effects of the gradation, scale, texture and optical illusions. The overview of the pattern repeats systems such as block, drop, half-drop, brick, irregular, composite, sateen, etc., will be illustrated by examples from French Art Deco, Neolithic vase decoration, Celtic stone cross carving, North American Indian beadwork, medieval Italian silk, Persian manuscript illuminations, Chinese cloisonne, and many more.

Pattern Applications:  
You will identify the different requirements for conceiving specific use of the pattern and learn how to apply their patterns to mock-up. Following the overview of the range of pattern applications for all kind of designs, from textiles and fashion to graphic design, wall and floor coverings for architecture and interior design, you would develop a prototype for large-scale interior application.  

How to Design Pattern Collection Portfolio:
The topic will help you familiarize yourself with the terms and highlight important steps in crafting perfect professional engaging pattern collection portfolio.
  
Class assignments:
Four creative projects will explore surface design pattern: designing mood-board and pattern motifs, seamless pattern repeat designs, pattern design application and final pattern collection portfolio. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.
