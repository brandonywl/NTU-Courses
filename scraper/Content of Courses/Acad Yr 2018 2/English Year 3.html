The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

From the first Apple Macintosh advert (which featured the tag line `why 1984 won't be like 1984') to Wikileaks (via Neil Postman's Amusing ourselves to death), in popular cultural cameos from David Bowie's Diamond Dogs to Haruki Murakami 1Q84, 1984 seems to be everywhere. In this course you'll explore the transformations of George Orwell's touchstone novel and this broader, mobile idea. To test out these ideas and to understand the shifting cultural contexts of `1984' as a metaphorical prism, we will focus on both the real events of 1984 (when Orwell's work was purportedly to have come true) as well as anticipations of an Orwellian future from the 1970s to the present day. By weaving together art history, literature, media, politics, technology and social activism, we will bring increasingly staid debates about postmodernism, mediatisation and the Cold War (another term coined by Orwell) back to critical life. This interdisciplinary course asks you to think both as a literary critic and cultural historian in order to reevalute this overdetermined juncture of modern life.

We will study canonical examples of English poetry, drama, and prose fiction written during the period 1660-1800. In order to contextualize these works historically, we will study major developments in England during this period, including evolutions in national identity; challenges to social hierarchies of class, race, and gender; and innovations in literary forms and genres.

Victorian Literature introduces a selection of literary works from the nineteenth century, while drawing attention to neglected aspects of this extremely versatile, fast changing, and intriguingly self-conscious age. The course aims to foster excitement about the indeterminacies, doubts, and fissures that shaped the Victorian period's greatest cultural achievements. At the same time, we shall critically reconsider the many legacies of the shifts it saw in epistemological, cultural, and specifically literary conceptualisations.

This module provides an overview of the most important works, themes, and concerns of the Victorian age, one of the most prolific periods of English literature. You will learn how to analyze, discuss, and write criticism about canonical texts and the popular culture of the time. You will also be encouraged to evaluate critically your attitudes and responses to "the Victorians".

In this course, we shall situate Singaporean literature more broadly within colonial and postcolonial representations of the region as well as within contemporary global developments in literature and culture. We shall take a critical look at the ways in which both residents and those passing through, immigrant groups and colonial powers, diasporic writers and the self-conscious "heartlander" represent Singapore, its history, its unique demography, and its urban culture. The texts we look at will therefore comprise locally as well as internationally published and circulated fiction as well as early writings by coloniser and colonised alike.

This course considers the manner in which art responds to war, and the ways in which war and violence are appropriated in both aesthetic and critical discourse. We will examine the centrality of war to human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to:

	the structural constitution of war
	the differences and similarities between war and violence
	the inherent ambivalence of war
	semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war
	artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture
	Just War or just war?
	visual vs textual representations

Over the last few decades, South Asian literature in English has achieved a global prominence that is unique among postcolonial literatures. In this module we will be tracing the historical development of South Asian writing from the colonial period to the present-day ? exploring, among other things, the impact of British colonial policy on its formation, the ongoing debate surrounding its use of an `imperial? language, and the reasons behind its phenomenal popularity. We will also be discussing some of the social and political issues with which this literature engages, whether it be the caste system, communal violence, or the vagaries of the postcolonial nation-state. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the Bollywood film Lagaan, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

This course surveys the development of a distinctly American literary culture and history in the nineteenth century. In exploring this expanding terrain, we will encounter new genres and media, consider the impact of race and gender on ideas of freedom and democracy, and assess the formation of an American canon. Our goal is a critical familiarity with texts that have claimed a place in American literary history and the social movements that produced them.

This module explores a diverse range of African literatures ? including works from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

We will be examining the representation of women during the Restoration and eighteenth century (1660-1800), roughly the span of the Enlightenment in England. With the scientific discoveries of Isaac Newton and others in the late seventeenth century, Western civilization experienced an epistemological shift from an adherence to traditional structures of authority (church, crown, patriarchal family) to the age of empiricism and a privileging of reason, evidence, and experientially acquired knowledge espoused by such philosophers as John Locke. This crisis of authority (reason versus revelation, evidence versus faith), exacerbated by the political upheavals and constitutional debates in the wake of England's Civil Wars and the Glorious Revolution, sent shock waves through all levels of society, including the domestic. 
How did women-having few political rights, little financial independence, and existing as legal nonentities when married-respond to this new age of discovery? The title of the course is meant to indicate the binary opposition of "good" and "bad" women with which real, complex women had to work in order to survive in society. The course itself will problematize that opposition in an effort to understand how women in an uncertain but exciting age could form and articulate their voices-as images of God, as rational beings, as rejects and misfits, as companions, wives, mothers, and citizens-in an effort to contribute to the public and private spheres and establish their own dignity as members of society.

This course is about more than just literature adaptations. In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature.
This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature. You will learn to analyze film adaptations and assess their impact on the reception of the source texts. It develops your skills in close reading, trains you in the theory and practice of adaptation, and enhances your knowledge and understanding of genre. Please refer to the planned weekly schedule for a specific list of topics.

This course explores competing versions of cosmopolitan and nationalitarian identity through a survey of important works by writers from nearby emerging economies (Malaysia and the Philippines). Among other matters, existential issues raised by urbanisation and industrial development will be addressed. The search for an idiom and imagery appropriate to a Southeast Asian locale, the challenge posed by primordialism, the issue of alternative modernities and the need to fashion a usable past from disparate material are other topics handled by the course. Students will be encouraged to formulate a first-cut analysis of where they place themselves with regards to these questions and concerns.

We will begin with Plato's Symposium, and move on to recent theorizations and philosophies of love.  More than simply addressing thematic concerns, this course will approach love as a philosophy and a discursive practice, as well as address the issues of subjectivity, the Self-Other relation and difference, all of which are central to love. Our final aim is to evaluate the potential for love to serve as a discourse of alterity.  We will be covering a variety of discourses and texts: philosophy, psychoanalysis, feminism and literary theory; film and literary works by both male and female authors and poets.

It is rare that a literary category attracts such a diversity of response and even rarer that the term is used with sufficient insight or precise understanding of what it might mean, if indeed it means anything.  In an attempt to unravel the meaning of the term, this course will consider a variety of texts (literature, prose essays, film etc) in an effort to locate a meaningful working definition of this most evasive of literary and cultural categories.

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of'- and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

To survey the achievement of Irish writing in English and translations of Irish litera'ture is to realise what a wide range of human experience is involved. It is expressed brilliantly in so many different ways by so many very differ'ent individuals. Many writers grappled with the notion of Irishness, and indeed many engaged in polemics. Others expressed the human condition without political engagement. Some transmuted the Celtic past; some found their inspiration in foreign cultural movements and ideas. Some claimed with Yeats that `ancient salt is [the] best packing,-  while others, like Joyce and Beckett, were manifestly experimental. We shall contextualise the history of Irish writing with the history of its politics, society and ideas. This survey is chronological: from the eighteenth century, celebrated for profound philoso-phical, aesthetic and political thought, renowned for the writings of Jonathan Swift, George Berkeley and Edmund Burke,  we move through the Romanticism of the nineteenth century, with its expressions of nationality and individuality, of authenticity and inauthenticity, of the Gothic and the rational, of the non-conformist New Woman and the conforming ultramontane, through the modernity, and after, of the twentieth century, to the neo-classicism of the spirited present.

In The History of the Book you will explore the impact of the book as an object and a technology, from medieval manuscripts to e-readers.  You will examine examples of books from different periods, both to understand how book production changed over time and to explore broader questions about the nature of texts, their reception, and their associated communities and contexts.  By learning how books were made and used, you will gain a clearer appreciation of how culture was shaped by the development of books, and how it shaped the development of books in turn.  The archival and research skills you learn during this course will serve you in future research projects.

This course explores the influence of the book as a force in history and literature from the medieval period to the present.  It will include hands-on examination of books and manuscript fragments as well as discussion of books as objects, social forces, and vehicles for text.

HL4038 Advanced Studies in Postcolonial Literature highlights the challenges faced by writers from the global south, namely domestication/exoticism which denies and subverts alterity. Such concerns are linked to the increasingly popular sub-geme, "postcolonial gothic", which is read as an ambivalent means to circumvent commodification. Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging. Texts may include Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger (2008), Raja Rao's Kanthapura (1938/1970), Jean Rhys'  Wide Sargasso Sea, and Beth Yahp's The Crocodile Sea.

Identifying a series of critical concepts essential to the conceptualization  and production of early children's literature (among them easiness, gradation, and abridgment), we will consider how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers have sought to convey challenging themes to young audiences as comprehensi bly, appealingly, and, at times, intensively as possible. How is the threat of child mortality treated in the New-England Primer's rhyming alphabet (1727) and Christina Rossetti's verse parable Goblin Market (1862)? How do Isaac Watts and George MacDonald respond differently to the challenge of introducing young readers to Christian theology? What taxonomic comparisons  might we locate between John Newbery's eighteenth-century compendiums and Victorian children's magazine? This course will also develop students' skills in using archival databases such as Eighteenth-Centurey Collections Online and Nineteenth-Century Collections Online.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.
