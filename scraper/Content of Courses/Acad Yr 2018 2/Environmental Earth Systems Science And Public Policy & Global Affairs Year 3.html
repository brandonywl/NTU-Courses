Course will combine theoretical lectures about the formation of crystals and main rocks types followed by lab work where the students will learn about the optical microscope and how to identify main minerals in hand specimen and under the microscope. The students will do a project about a rock of their choice where they will have to identify main components, provide a geological background, and also ideas as why the rock in question might be important for research or society. 
During the project the student will learn how to organize information and cite literature as in scientific research papers. There is also an analytical component where the students will learn what are the main techniques to determine the composition and textures of rock and minerals, plus have hands on experience about making a thin section, taking images of the minerals with the optical microscope and obtain backscattered electron images using the scanning electron microscope.

This course introduces students to process geomorphology, sedimentology and stratigraphic principles, and provides tools for the interpretation of sediments and sedimentary rocks and basins.  Lectures in weeks 1-2 cover sediments composition, sediment transport and sedimentary structures. Lecture in week 3 introduces the facies approach to sedimentology and
geomorphology. The second phase moves to conceptualise the processes of formation, transport and deposition of sediment. During lectures in weeks 5-8 students develop conceptual models for the full range of landscapes and sedimentary environments on earth, from desert dunes to deep seas muds and coral reefs to gravel bed rivers. Lectures from weeks 8-11 introduce the concepts of sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary basin analysis. The lecture series is supplemented by 8 laboratory exercises and 2 field trips the first a half day
and the second a 4 day trip to Miri in Malaysia. The field program is a major part of the course
both in content and assessment.

The discipline of Law & Economics and its application of economic analysis to law, provides a useful framework for understanding and evaluating sustainability and environmental policies. Good governance, legal frameworks and incentive structures play important roles in sustainable economic development. This course is designed to give students from all disciplines (economics majors and non-majors) an introduction to law and economics in the context of environmental protection and sustainable development.

Environmental issues have entered the centre of international politics and global governance in the recent two decades. This course is to introduce global environmental politics and governance (actors, institutions, mechanisms, norms and power dynamics) to students, and examine the topic by a typology of three categories: global common pool resource, transboundary environmental disputes, and local accumulative environmental change. The course encourages and mentors student?s independent research and critical thinking beyond readings and classroom discussion by assigning them into groups and conduct in-depth case studies, taking them to visit an environmental organization with global outreach and impact, and guiding them to incorporate first-hand observation into systemic learning. Via multiple learning sources and innovative teaching methods, the course aims at opening a compound, dynamic and interdisciplinary field to the students.

This is an introductory course designed for those across all specialisations. It will complement student?s learning in E2S2 courses and the Introductory field experience in Bali. As it is an introductory course, the aim is to provide background understanding for the students to build upon in later or concurrent courses. Students will learn about a number of different natural hazards, their geological or geographic setting, the physical processes that create the hazard, their potential impacts and how or if the impacts can be mitigated. Students will also carry individual studies of key hazardous sites and events. This course will give students an insight into hazard and risk assessment and a thorough understanding of the natural hazards threatening humans.

This introductory course is designed for undergraduate students from all specializations in years 1 and 2. The course will provide you with a comprehensive view of the history, current status, and
mitigation strategies for air pollution and  climate change. As this is an introductory course, the course  will be comprehensive  rather than  specific. You will be expected to  read and discuss historically important papers in the area in order to better understand how scientific findings have changed the world both at national and international levels.

The class content
1) History of atmospheric chemical composition
2)	Basics of atmospheric physics necessary to understand air pollution problems and climate change
3)	Various types of air pollution/climate change issues, including photochemical smog,haze, indoor air pollution,acid rain, ozone reduction in the stratosphere, and climate change

The class will cover concepts in both global geophysics and applied geophysics, w ith an emphasis on research done at NTU. The main goal of this class is to provide students with general understandin g of some techniques that are u sed to probe the Earth's su rface. The techniques that w ill be presented  during this class are used  in both private sectors as well as in Earth science in general.
This course will serve as an introduction to the stud y of Earth phenom ena such as gravity, earthquakes, plate movements and magnetism as well as what they tell u s about the deep Earth. In addition we will study the response of the Earth to various signals (e.g. reflection seismic, GPR, resistivity , etc.) and how we can u se this to better understand the subsurface. The class will have a theoretical part as well as complimentary tutorials where we will acquire (when possible) and process data.

The means by which living things put together or break down complex molecules and derive energy will be the foundation for the course. Some of these processes will be universal whilst others may be specific to plants, animals or subsets thereof. Movement, transport, and signaling will be added to the basic physiological framework.  Adaptations to variations in environment will segue into physiological ecology, which will integrate all course content in the context of nature?s laboratory ? complex ecosystems.

Since the 1950s, the `great acceleration' in human induced impacts on the environment has heralded the new epoch of the Anthopocene. The increasing global population, combined with rising incomes, means the world's environmental and natural resources are under significant pressure. Management of these environmental pressures in a way which ensures sustainability is now a priority in many environmental conventions and agreements. This course will provide in depth knowledge on techniques that can be used to quantify and value environmental resources, and the management strategies that can be implemented for different systems. An understanding of these processes is essential for Environmental Science majors who wish to work in consultancy positions, government bodies, NGOs or private companies in this field.
