The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

Accounting plays a vital role in business organizations' strive for resources and performance. Through the provision of useful information, accounting helps organizations attract resources from external stakeholders, and helps internal stakeholders manage these resources, to achieve the targeted performance. The process not only facilitates the creation of value for organizations and their stakeholders, it also benefits the economy and society as a whole, by helping to direct resources to where they can be more productive.

Based upon the foundation established in the predecessor course AA101, this course focuses on the relevance of accounting information to internal stakeholders, i.e. management, to make decisions and achieve control in their strive for performance. Emphasis is placed on both the provision, as well as the application, of accounting information.

This course provides students with the conceptual background and analytical skills that are necessary to identify, assess and apply information for the purposes of analysing and valuing business activities and entities. The course employs the agency framework within a capital market context to help students develop the necessary analysis and valuation skills.

Emphasis is placed on integrating the use of financial and non-financial information in business valuation and analysis, involving strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial analysis, prospective analysis and valuation. The course allows students to understand the critical issue of determining the specific types of information that are relevant in ex ante valuation and ex post analysis of business entities and their activities. Students are also expected to be aware of the benefits and costs of acquiring and using such information.
 
Cases and projects are used to develop and integrate the business analysis and valuation concepts.  Healthy scepticism is emphasized, as students are encouraged to challenge the assumptions and facts related to each issue. 

After the completion of this course, students should understand and appreciate some of the rationales and characteristics that underlie business practices and financial reporting. Students should also appreciate the myriad interactions among the process of business analysis and valuation, the use of information sets (accounting and non-accounting), and the workings of the capital markets.

Students are expected to develop important knowledge, skills and attitudes in AA301. The main objectives are to develop students? (1) social and interpersonal skills, (2) technical knowledge of specific accounting standards, (3) technical knowledge of business valuation, (4) creative and critical thinking, (5) tolerance for ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and (6) strategic thinking and leadership capabilities in a vibrant environment.
