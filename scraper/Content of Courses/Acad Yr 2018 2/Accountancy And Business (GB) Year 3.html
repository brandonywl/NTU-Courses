The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

The purpose of this course is to help students to develop a strong conceptual foundation in accounting information systems, a necessary pre-requisite for effective performance in accountants and auditors in the current digital era. The course enables the students to understand, evaluate and use Accounting Information Systems effectively in their future roles as accountants, managers, consultants, or auditors. 

The course seeks to: 
1)	Provide an in-depth understanding of key business processes of an organization, and how
         the data captured during the business process flow through to management and financial
         accounting.
2)	Train students to model key business process activities and identify risk and control
          issues related to a business process
3)	Provide comprehensive knowledge about AIS packages and enterprise resource planning
         (ERP) packages and explain how AIS/ERP packages are implemented.
4)	Provide students with an overview of some key modules of an ERP and teach students the
         skills of using an industry standard package such as SAP. 

Students will study how AIS/ERP is deployed in common business transactions. They will learn about the information flow in fundamental accounting processes and the major risks and controls associated with these processes. Students will be taught on how data is captured, processed, stored and accessed for generating management information and business reports and documents.

Students will gain hands-on training on ERP usage via lab sessions on SAP ? an industry standard ERP package. With an understanding of the systems development process and knowledge of AIS deployment in accounting and business processes from pre-lab sessions, students will gain an appreciation of the underlying workings of a typical ERP/AIS. This learning and experience will equip them with knowledge for more effective sourcing, selection, implementation and deployment of AIS/ERP packages in practice. In addition, students will also learn how they can make use of Excel for more effective reporting from the data generated through AIS/ERP packages.

AA306 is designed to provide students with a good understanding and appreciation of the operating and financial risks that firms face, and with a strong conceptual and technical knowledge in the measurement, reporting and analysis of these risks.

To provide focus to this course, emphasis is placed on two major areas:

The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.

This course is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current law for the protection of electronic information and electronic content as forms of property. Conversely this course also looks at the potential liability for misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. 

The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis,  interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with trademarks and brands embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works. This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in IP law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication ? or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.
