The course begins with an understanding of key terminology in creative industry economics and policy. It will then look at the policy decisions, local environment, and intellectual influences that led up to the Creative Industries Development Strategy in 2002. The course then covers the direct and indirect effects from this strategy and examines the present day eco-system that includes icons like Esplanade, Singapore Art Museum, Museum of Asian Civilizations, and National Gallery of Singapore. 
Coursework Assignments:

Oral presentations:

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

You will be introduced to the storyboard as a thinking tool, through which creative ideas are developed and given detail. You will learn to employ artistic tools like framing, camera movement, character movement and key visuals within the larger structure of the entire narrative. The role of the storyboard within the animation pipeline and its relevance to concept development, script development, animatics and production design will be covered. The course will focus partucularly focus on the aspects of animation production design that support the dramatic impact of the story. Further insight will be gained of the connection between visual development and storyboard through exercises and assignments on character design, environment and prop design.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.
