Students will review public administration literature developed in different times. Through the lens of chronology, students will be able to compare critical thinking in the late 1800s, early 1900s, between two World Wars, during Cold War, New Public Management era, and today. By taking this course, students will be able to clearly define public administration, especially its relationships with other related disciplines. More importantly, they are expected to draw a big picture of public administration in the next decade.

This course will provide students with a theoretical interrogation of the concept of democracy, particularly as it relates to the issue of social division. Throughout the history of political thought, theorists from Plato to John Rawls have recognized that division is the essence of the sphere of politics: divisions continually emerge between different parts of the political community, between those who claim different titles to govern, those with differing desires and needs, those with opposing visions of the common good, and so on. With few exceptions, however, the tradition's canonical thinkers have seen this plurality as a condition that needs to be overcome, not as one to be affirmed. In this course we will study a variety of twentieth-century political theorists who have not only recognized the fact of human difference, but who argue that the realization of democracy depends upon precisely the affirmation of this difference.  Democracy is thus essentially related to the effort to give an expression to the multiplicity of social forms of doing, being, and thinking that internally differentiate all political societies. Students will be encouraged to contrast this understanding of democracy with those contemporary ones that emphasize the values of social harmony and consensus, providing them with a ground to critically probe actually existing political institutions and orders.

This course introduces students to an in-depth examination of the forces that influence the behavior of public administrators engaged in the public sector decision-making process on economic issues. Based on diverse theoretical and practical perspectives, students are able to learn various market and bureaucratic scenarios including micro- and macro-economic problems and impacts and how tools of modern political economy can be used to address contemporary policy questions. By leading classes along with discussions, students are encouraged to marshal facts embedded in the public decision making, analyze research literature, critically examine the pros and cons, and support educated conclusion as potentially qualified public administrators and policymakers.

This course provides students with basic principles of political economy and applies them to public administration issues on the interaction of the public and private sectors of our economy at an advanced level. In a broader manner, this course will cover the following questions:
1. What is the market failure?
2. When can government play a role in improving market outcomes?
3.  How can we evaluate whether a policy is likely to be effective?
4. What are the potential pitfalls associated with government involvement in markets (bureaucratic failure)?
5. How can public managers improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their organizations?

Policy/program evaluation constitutes a key element of contemporary policymaking and refers to a comprehensive, often multi-year study of program/policy function and outcomes. This course will expose students to: 1) the complexity and scope of policy evaluation; and 2) the basic methods of policy and program evaluation. The social, political, and ethical contexts of evaluation will also be covered in the class.

Throughout the semester, we will look at evaluation examples that have been conducted on public issues, programs, and policies to demonstrate key points. We will also work through the application of fundamental evaluation concepts and techniques, and at the same time address a range of measurement issues, the basics of analysis, and reporting of performance data. Students will be exposed to a number of evaluation studies and will have hands-on experience of designing evaluation projects.

This course explores the role of religion in society, with particular relation to conflict, violence and peacebuilding processes. It begins by introducing methods and theories in the study of religion, but with a focus on religion in social and political contexts in plural societies. In the latter part of the course, you will embark on an investigation into the relationship between religion, violence and peacebuilding. This will be based on understanding the theological and social aspects of how religion relates to diversity, including notions of identity. There will be a consideration of a range of case studies, sources and texts, while you will be guided to analyse different kinds of arguments and practices that communities, intellectuals, and activists use to promote peace and violence.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.
