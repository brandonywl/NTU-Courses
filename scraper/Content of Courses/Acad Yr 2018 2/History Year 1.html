Asia-Pacific in Global History: From 1800 examines major themes which inform the
study of world history following the start of the 19th century, particularly in two related
areas: trade and migration against the backdrop of colonialism, imperialism and nationbuilding.
The study of global history from an Asia-Pacific perspective looks at the history
of globalization which is not strictly defined in economic terms, but is informed by
themes, such as migration, environment, imperialism, biological exchange, etc. Even
though the year chosen is 1800, the foundation for changes which marked China and
Asia`s entry into the global economic system was laid in the middle of the 18th century.
In particular, one can point to the institution of the Canton system established by the
Chinese government to facilitate foreign trade, but which had various unforeseen
economic, social, and political repercussions. Through 13 weeks of lectures, students
will not only examine various themes such as migration, diaspora, colonialism,
nationalism, and trade which relate generally to global historical studies, but they will
also participate in current debates pertaining to the issues of global economic crises
and climate change.

In this class, students will become familiar with what some historians term 'The American Irony' - that American citizens have consistently acquired independence, freedom, and affluence by conquering, enslaving, and impoverishing other peoples. Students will explore the major events that shaped the development of the United States, from the colonial period through the War on Terror. In the process they will learn how the United States rose to a position of global hegemony, and question whether that situation is likely to endure. This class will particularly focus on issues of race, class, and gender, which carry relevance beyond the boundaries of the United States.

This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

There are approximately 46 million ethnic Chinese living outside the Mainland, Hong
Kong, Taiwan and Macau today. This course will examine the emergence and
transformation of Chinese international migration in the global context of China`s
interactions with the outside world and diaspora`s changing patterns of political, social
and cultural adaptations. Although it will trace the historical origins of modern Chinese
migration dating back to the mid-19th century, this course focuses on the post-1945 era,
particularly the period after 1978 when China began its economic reform and openingup.
Apart from examining the linkages with the homeland and transnational ties that
connect the Chinese diaspora globally, this course pays special attention to the regions
of Asia, Europe and North America. The central themes to be explored in this courses
include the historicity of modern Chinese migration, changing faces/fates of
Chineseness, complex ethnic and cultural identities and the emergence of Chinese
transnationalism, cross-border social and business networks, diaspora`s role in China`s
economic development and foreign relations, and comparative and theoretical
approaches to Chinese international migration.

In this class, students will explore the innovative field of marine environmental history. They will discover that, although oceans appear pristine and timeless, human societies have been modifying marine environments for centuries. In turn, these modified environments have shaped the course of human history. Students will examine how numerous societies around the world and through time have developed relationships with the sea, some of them sustainable and some of them not. Students will also learn about the complex systems of international cooperation that have emerged to facilitate the conservation of mobile marine species. Finally, students will learn how perceptions of oceans and ocean creatures have changed in response to cultural and scientific developments.

The course will progress chronologically from pre-Imperial China to modern times, highlighting different periods of transition. Each class/topic is coupled with different theoretical and critical approaches, which will help you consider how evidence and sources relate to research approaches.  Classes will outline internal changes, different medical approaches by different actors, processes of importation and translation, and top-down rationalisation and standardization.   You will learn how different kinds of practice and theory became ?mainstream,? for whom, and in what time period, and in so doing, come to a broad synthetic understanding of Chinese medical culture. This will build to a reflection on the continuity and change in the modern biomedical context of Chinese medicine, and how medical heritage has become a site of cultural negotiation.  The course will contain opportunity for hands-on experience of different traditional healing arts, as well as site-visits to different locations on and off campus.

The history of feminist movements sheds light on the gender structures of politics and citizenship, while debates about feminism illuminate contestations over gender and sexual norms.  This course will use the history of feminism as a springboard to analyse broader questions surrounding the political, social and cultural history of gender in the modern world.  Since feminists have been at the forefront of questioning political and social norms, this course will examine the intellectual history of feminist thought, as well as the feminist `uses' of history.  It will take a `transnational' approach, not only comparing feminist movements in various parts of the world, but also examining the international networks forged by feminists and the manner in which transnational connections shaped local and national feminist movements.  

The course begins by considering several historiographical questions, in particular, when did feminism `begin', what were its main periods or `waves' and what has constituted `feminism' historically?  We will then investigate the role of transnational connections, imperialism, nationalism, class and race in shaping nineteenth and early twentieth century feminism.  The second half of the course examines late twentieth century and twenty-first century feminism, especially the inclusions and exclusions of feminist movements on the basis of class, race, sexuality and other social markers.  We will also investigate the role of the internet and social media in shaping recent feminist organizing and thought.

As obvious as it may be that history unfolds in time, we often lose sight that time itself has a history. This course explores three important elements of the history of time: its intellectual conception and cultural representation; its scientific and technological quantification, rationalization, and mastery; and its role in structuring societies and their activities. First, over the course of history, different cultures have conceived of time in a variety of ways (e.g. circular, cyclical, progressive) and on many different scales (e.g. cosmic, geologic, civilizational, industrial). In turn, these cultural conceptions of time have given rise to different ideas about the relationship of individual human lives to societies, and societies to history as a whole. Second, the effort to quantify time has given rise to a distinct science and technology of time-keeping, from the ancient sun-dial to today?s atomic clock. Third, the consciousness and quantification of time has made possible numerous social institutions and practices, ranging from the invention of interest on debt to the modern state to the institution of wage-labor. Through discussions of secondary texts and primary sources (including films, art works, and literary texts) this course will explore the history of time as a critical element of human experience from antiquity to present. Through the course, students will practice aesthetic analysis, formulating arguments, historical and cultural knowledge, and critical thinking.

This course is designed with the aim of enabling Arts and Humanities students to carefully research and analyze texts, reflect on them, and write disciplinarily appropriate essays.  The basic premise of the course is that effective writing in the Arts and Humanities is based on excellent, informed, and interdisciplinary analysis of original texts.  Students will be exposed to a variety of primary texts from their own discipline, as well as those of other disciplines in the Arts and Humanities, and taught how to approach and analyze them.  They will furthermore be taught how to incorporate and use arguments from secondary sources, how to develop strong research questions, and how to research and put together a strong research paper. Throughout, the course emphasizes a consideration of the how other disciplines contribute to research in their own discipline.
