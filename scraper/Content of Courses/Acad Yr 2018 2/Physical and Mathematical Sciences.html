The Food Physics course is a course on structure-property relationship in common food products. Specific types of systems that will be discussed in this course are polymer solutions, proteins solutions, gels, sauces, and dairy products. The course gives and overview of the molecular and colloidal interactions found in food products, and discusses the effect of these interactions on stability of these products. Structures formed by proteins, with particular emphasis on secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures, and the role of interactions in the formation and stability of these structures is discussed. The course also discusses various types of rheological behaviour that can be observed in common food products. The properties of macromolecules affecting their thickening functionality are described. The concept of surface tension and its role in various phenomena is introduced.

The course aims to equip you with basic technological awareness, particularly computer controlled electronics and 3D printing, and hands-on skills required for building basic equipment and products related to Science and Technology. Through this course, you will develop creativity as you are encouraged to explore different approaches to a given problem, and resilience when facing the need to acquire new technological skills in a limited time in order to solve a given problem. Finally, you will have the opportunity to share and refine your ideas with other makers and tinkerers in this course.
