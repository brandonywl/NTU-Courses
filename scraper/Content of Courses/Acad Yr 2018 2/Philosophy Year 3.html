The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

This course begins with a consideration of the history of the field of study. This is followed by a discussion of the methods used in current research, including concepts and techniques from a variety of disciplines: primatology, archaeology, paleontology, anthropology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and child language acquisition. A review of major theories that have been put forward in recent years to explain how language might have evolved from earlier forms of representation and communication will then be given. This includes Pinker's language instinct theory, Gould's `spandrel theory', Lieberman's speech theory, Dunbar's `gossip theory', Deacon's language-brain co-evolution theory and others.

From the first Apple Macintosh advert (which featured the tag line `why 1984 won't be like 1984') to Wikileaks (via Neil Postman's Amusing ourselves to death), in popular cultural cameos from David Bowie's Diamond Dogs to Haruki Murakami 1Q84, 1984 seems to be everywhere. In this course you'll explore the transformations of George Orwell's touchstone novel and this broader, mobile idea. To test out these ideas and to understand the shifting cultural contexts of `1984' as a metaphorical prism, we will focus on both the real events of 1984 (when Orwell's work was purportedly to have come true) as well as anticipations of an Orwellian future from the 1970s to the present day. By weaving together art history, literature, media, politics, technology and social activism, we will bring increasingly staid debates about postmodernism, mediatisation and the Cold War (another term coined by Orwell) back to critical life. This interdisciplinary course asks you to think both as a literary critic and cultural historian in order to reevalute this overdetermined juncture of modern life.

We will begin with Plato's Symposium, and move on to recent theorizations and philosophies of love.  More than simply addressing thematic concerns, this course will approach love as a philosophy and a discursive practice, as well as address the issues of subjectivity, the Self-Other relation and difference, all of which are central to love. Our final aim is to evaluate the potential for love to serve as a discourse of alterity.  We will be covering a variety of discourses and texts: philosophy, psychoanalysis, feminism and literary theory; film and literary works by both male and female authors and poets.

It is rare that a literary category attracts such a diversity of response and even rarer that the term is used with sufficient insight or precise understanding of what it might mean, if indeed it means anything.  In an attempt to unravel the meaning of the term, this course will consider a variety of texts (literature, prose essays, film etc) in an effort to locate a meaningful working definition of this most evasive of literary and cultural categories.

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of'- and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

From the invention of the ploughshare to the rise of the Internet, technological advancement makes an impact on economic organisation, social relations, and cultural life. In developing this central theme, this course begins with an understanding of the rise of science as a social institution and as a predominant form of rationality. In addition to understanding basic shifts in the experience of time and space brought about by scientific and technological advances, the course considers specific changes in the way that people live, learn, work and play. The human and social consequences  benefits and costs  of the impact of such advances are also examined.

Rapid advancement in science and technology presents individuals and societies with a unprecedented array of challenges. This course explores the social, ethical and policy issues associated with scientific and technological advancement by posing questions such as the following: What is science? How is scientific knowledge created, disseminated and adopted? How are discoveries and inventions made and accepted? What is the nature of scientific and technological progress? How is it influenced by social, political, economic and cultural factors? What are the roles of universities, research institutes and industrial or business partners? In examining the social implications and consequences of the new scientific ideas and technological applications, the course scrutinizes developments in multiple fields, including the life sciences, medicine, engineering and digital media.

What is the right thing to do? What is the fundamental nature of the universe? Are there limits to knowledge? These questions, which we continue to ask today, were also pondered and debated by philosophers over two thousand years ago, and in trying to answer them, they developed sophisticated systems of thought. This course aims to teach students the
views of the highly influential philosophers of ancient Greece, Rome, and other regions of the ancient world. The main philosophers covered will be Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and some of the Pre-Socratics. The course is structured around several topics, including ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.

This course introduces the canonical thinkers (Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Hume) in philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course challenges students to think about epistemological and metaphysical questions through these historical thinkers. Key questions include, 'What is the self?' 'What the source of knowledge?' 'Can we know the world as it is?' etc. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop high level critical thinking and writing skills by examining these historical texts and be challenged to think about the richness of philosophical issues that resulted from the new modern science.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

The first half of the module examines the following question: What are race and gender? We begin by examining ?commonsense? (i.e., non-academic) concepts of race and gender that have been influential both historically and into the present day.  The shortcomings of the commonsense views of race and gender then provide a segue into an examination of attempts by scholars from a variety of disciplines to provide more adequate definitions of race and gender.  One major category of proposals state that race and gender are socially constructed categories.  Another major category of proposals says that concepts of race and gender can be grounded in biology, albeit in a different way that the ?commonsense? view claims.  Strengths and weaknesses of each of these proposals are examined.

The second half of the module builds on the first half by examining the social, political, and ethical dimensions of race and gender.  One overarching topic concerns the relationship between race/gender and inequality, as well as arguments for and against proposals such as affirmative action that are intended to remedy racial/gender inequalities.  Another major topic is the role that race and gender plays in shaping our social and political institutions, with specific sub-topics including race/gender and political representation as well as the role of race and gender in the criminal justice system.  A third topic is the psychology of race and gender, with particular attention to the ways in which stereotypes can (often unconsciously) shape our interactions and expectations.  The final topic is intersectionality, a theoretical framework for examining the ways in which race, gender, and other social categories interact to shape individual experiences.

Metaethical inquiry aims to address a number of interrelated semantic, metaphysical, psychological, and epistemological questions about the nature of ethics. In this course we will address the following questions: What do ethical judgments mean? Are they true or false? If they are true or false, in virtue of what? If they are true or false, can knowledge of them be had? How, or why not? If they are not true or false, what status do they have? The goal of this course is to explore the answers that have been given to these questions by the most influential writings in metaethics.

The aim of normative ethical theory is to rationally assess moral thought. In this course, we explore what it takes to make moral thinking rational.  
 
This course is an advanced survey of contemporary analytic moral philosophy. It primarily covers theories in normative ethics' consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, etc. Related areas -e.g., meta-ethics, value theory, and moral standing - will be visited more briefly.

Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships. While most famously studied in the context of biological relationships (which species share common ancestry, or whether all species descend from a common ancestor), it can also be applied in the field of linguistics to establish relationships between languages or language families. There are many well-documented parallels between biological and linguistic evolution, and the driving question of this course will be to determine whether these similarities justify the use of a shared set of phylogenetic methods and assumptions for both systems. In this course, we will study the main methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, the assumptions that these methods depend on, and some applications of these methods in other historical fields.
