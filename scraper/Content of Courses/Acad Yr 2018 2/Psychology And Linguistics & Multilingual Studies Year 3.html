This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world?s population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

Like so many other aspects of life, language communication has been revolutionised by the introduction of the Internet. This course explores how the structure and use of English have been shaped by the popularity of new modes of communication made available by the Internet: SMS, e-mail, chatrooms, Internet Relay Chat, Usenet newsgroups, World Wide Web pages, and virtual worlds. The implications of these changes for our thinking and understanding of language will also be discussed.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

The course explores the interaction of language and culture from linguistic, sociological and anthropological points of view. Using linguistic and social theories as a basis, this course will demonstrate how the treatment of language and culture issues might pose a danger of propagating stereotypes. It will also question the transference and translation of languages across cultures. Pragmatic theories will be also used to explain the causes of cross-cultural misunderstandings. Other topics discussed include the role of prosody and nonverbal behaviour in communication; factors influencing conversational style in different discourse contexts; the negotiation of power and solidarity in intercultural communication; the socialisation of language, and the creation of an identity from a child language acquisition perspective.

This course begins with a consideration of the history of the field of study. This is followed by a discussion of the methods used in current research, including concepts and techniques from a variety of disciplines: primatology, archaeology, paleontology, anthropology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and child language acquisition. A review of major theories that have been put forward in recent years to explain how language might have evolved from earlier forms of representation and communication will then be given. This includes Pinker's language instinct theory, Gould's `spandrel theory', Lieberman's speech theory, Dunbar's `gossip theory', Deacon's language-brain co-evolution theory and others.

In this course we will examine how language is represented and learnt in the brain.  Cutting-edge findings from state of the art techniques using functional neuroimaging and lesion studies will be reviewed to enable students to understand the workings of the human brain in relation to language use. Specific aspects of language processing such as meaning representation, speech perception and learning, learning disabilities as well as the bilingual brain will be introduced. Basic neuroanatomy will also be covered to enable students to pursue further studies. This course introduces functional neuroimaging at an advanced level.

The course will focus on critical topics that affect multilingual individuals in multilingual communities across the lifespan. The approach is interdisciplinary as the readings will be drawn from psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and education. The students will read advanced theoretical discussion of multilingualism as a phenomenon and reflect on why the current research scope needs to be extended to include multilinguals and not just bilinguals. The primary focus of the course is on evaluating how multilingualism alters our perception of the world from a cognitive perspective. However, the importance of social contexts and its modulating impact on cognition will be a central theme in this course. The readings will also be geared towards an in depth understanding of the methodological concerns in the field.. 

At the end of the course, students will be more able to ask incisive questions relevant to the field and develop a topic for research. Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to pursue their own data collection for their own independent research in a multilingual context.

The course considers the socio-cultural and linguistic factors involved in language maintenance, shift, loss and revival from a societal, community and government perspective. The main emphasis is on understanding the range of complex individual and community based communicative and interactional settings and processes involved in the processes. The secondary focus of this course is to understand the governments' political and ideological role in language maintenance, shift, loss and revival. The course also considers ways communities and governments can cooperate to achieve shared language objectives.

This course begins with an introduction to an empirical approach to language description and comparison frorn a cognitive perspective, plus introduction to information structure concepts, which fundamental to understanding language structure. A range of linguistic forms and functions are then compared and contrasted systematically at different levels of analysis, attempting to highlight the cognitive differences in the mindsets of the speakers (how they cut up or "chunk" their experiences and represent them in language forms) that lead to the languages manifesting different patterns.

Using materials from Mainland and Island Southeast Asia, the course will have two main themes:
 
Language-external: (a) The region?s array of languages examined historically and sociolinguistically. (b) The use of linguistic data in uncovering the region?s social and cultural history. (c) Language-change and language-loss in the face of present-day political pressures. (d) Language-engineering in the region?s nation-states. 

Language-internal: (a) Critical discussion of the various theoretical approaches to language-and-culture issues, both old and new, especially as presented in the literature of linguistic anthropology. (b) Discussion of the extent to which the organisation (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) of languages relates to their cultural and social contexts in which they are spoken.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

Psychologists have long studied the human condition in its many manifestations of weaknesses, damages and maladaptive behaviors. Yet, the discipline of psychology must also understand and appreciate the character, strengths and virtues of human life, including those relevant to the concepts of happiness, hope, motivation, mindfulness, resilience, gratitude and compassion, all of which enable individuals to thrive and flourish, while contributing to the health and well-being of family and society. This course provides a review of the literature, research, methodology and experiential practice of Positive Psychology, as well as their applications toward personal growth and social betterment.

Decisions about what to eat and how much eat are among the most pervasive judgments and cognitions humans navigate in their daily lives. These decisions around food and subsequent eating behaviors have significant impact for health and well-being, given the rising incidences of chronic diseases associated with dietary patterns, such as obesity and type-2 diabetes. This class will cover psychological, social, and environmental processes that guide people's cognitions and behaviors related to food and eating. A major theme of the class will focus on psychosocial and non-homeostatic factors that modulate appetite, and the psychological processes that may regulate or bias one's experience of hunger and fullness. This class will adopt a holistic and integrative approach to study of these questions by examining the role of diverse contextual factors (social, cultural, economic, and evolutionary) in influencing the psychological processes regulating appetite and food intake patterns. By completing this course, students will have deeper understanding of key findings and theories related to psychological and behavioral aspects of human nutrition, ability to apply this knowledge to design studies to test their own hypotheses about eating behavior, and be equipped as more critical consumers of research pertaining to these topics. Given rising national and international priorities for addressing chronic diseases linked to dietary behavior (e.g., Singapore's War on Diabetes), this course will provide students experience for potential future involvement in organizations, initiatives, and research targeting these health issues.

Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Memory is vital for defining who we are, by allowing us to base actions on knowledge gleaned from previous experiences.  It also is important for performing everyday tasks so that we can keep track of intermediate stages before a behavior is completed. Research in memory concerns more than pure storage. It also focuses on how memories are used by examining strategic selection, executive processes, and the interaction with other cognitive functions including attention, perception, and decision making. Modern research has focused on discovering the mechanisms of memory by examining the neural basis of memory.

This course provides an introduction to psychological perspectives on criminal and antisocial
behavior. It will also incorporate knowledge from interdisciplinary areas to examine the interplay
between psychological,social, and biological factors in predisposing to crime and violence. Different developmental trajectories and forms of crime and criminals will be discussed.
Throughout the course, we will also attempt to bridge the basic science of criminal behavior with the real world through case studies and discussion of the implications of psychological and criminological research for the criminal justice system. The content of this course deals with the
developmental, neuroscience, clinical, social, and cognitive subdivisions of psychology.

This course is an introduction to the principles underlying educational and psychological measurement and testing. The general goals of this course are to explore the nature, problems, challenges and potential of psychology testing. The first half of the course is devoted to the foundations of psychological testing in various contexts. As part of this we examine topics such as the historical roots of psychological testing, uses of psychological tests, ethical considerations, and technical and methodological principles involved in developing and evaluating test materials. The second section of the course surveys major types of psychological tests, such as intellectual ability, educational aptitude, personality and assessment in the workplace. By the end of the course students are expected to understand the basics of test theory and test construction, and be able to critically evaluate the tests that we consider in the course which are drawn from tests commonly used in the field of psychological testing

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

This applied module covers an introduction to the forensic psychology of crime, terrorism and disasters. This course will benefit those who have an interest in working in or with the police, prisons, civil defence, child custody areas, community forensic psychology as well as counselling, clinical and/or forensic settings. It will provide a ?realistic preview? of the work of a psychologist working in applied forensic contexts. Additionally, because working in forensic setting can be stressful, distressing and sometimes traumatic (e.g. dealing with bereaving families or dealing with potentially challenging clientele), this module also discusses employee assistance infrastructures such as counselling and peer counselling programs within police and law enforcement organizations. An applied psychologist working in police, fire or other law enforcement settings would need to appreciate how aspects of counselling psychology, criminological/legal psychology and organizational psychology all come together to address the real world problems faced in applied forensic settings.

The aim of this course is to outline how best available research is integrated with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preference to achieve evidence-based practice in clinical psychology. The course covers empirically supported treatments (cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic) for major problem areas (depression, personality disorders, neuropsychological impairment) and examines elements of effective therapy relationships (empathy, working alliance, collecting patient feedback) as well as effective methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient (reactance/resistance level, preferences, culture, religion and spirituality). This course aims to encourage a critical stance when considering the empirical status of treatment models and their clinical applications and provides hands-on experience in adopting elements of a therapeutic relationship.

The aim of this course is to equip students with an understanding of the application of psychology in a correctional setting. Students will be instructed on the causes and motivations behind offending behaviour. This would help students to identify factors associated with offending behaviour, in order that these factors can be elicited in assessment and addressed in intervention. Emphasis will be placed on how specific offender populations (sex offenders, violent offenders, drug offenders, juvenile offenders, women offenders) are assessed, and how intervention principles and strategies are adapted to address specific concerns by these groups. This course aims to encourage students to adopt a scientist-practitioner approach in offender rehabilitation, by considering evidence-based research to influence applied practice.

This applied module aims to introduce you to the theories and practices of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (Occupational Psychology) as applied to individuals at work and to organisations. Students who have an interest in applying psychology to work settings will be exposed to a scope of topics that are relevant to the practice in both private and public sectors. 
 
The course aims to develop students? theoretical understanding as well as knowledge of the practical tools and solutions that are applied in the IO practice. The contextual learning is to help students understand the consulting cycle and stakeholder engagements unique to the IO practice. The intention is to provide the students a fairly comprehensive primer to what they may expect in further education and a career in the IO specialisation. 
 
The course will have a strong emphasis on applied skills. Each seminar will be structured such that students are exposed less to the theories of I/O Psychology and more to how they are practiced within organisations. This will include exposure to best guidelines as set by standard-setting bodies, commercial products and solutions commonly used in industry, and case studies to discuss the ethics of psychological societies of different nations.

Psychology is the study of mind and behavior and using a comparative approach we can study the lives of other organisms to help understand psychology. Non-human primates share similar traits with human beings and therefore studies on them have provided useful comparison for understanding the basis of human behavior. In this course, we will be reviewing primate research that has advanced our understanding of psychological phenomena. We will focus on social behavior and cognition, and will explore how biology-environment interactions influence aggression, conflict resolution, parenting, sexuality, emotion, personality, communication, and social cognition. This course will provide an understanding on the basic components of a social mind and how we use primates as models for understanding behavior

This course provides graduate students with an advanced introduction to empirical findings, methods, and theoretical perspectives from the field of psycholinguistics, as they pertain to the relationship between language, perception and thought. In the first half of the semester, the Whorfian Hypothesis will be introduced. Topics will include grammatical gender, categorical perception, spatial and numerical cognition. Perspectives from the domain of cross-modal perception and synaesthesia will be introduced to provide neurological bases for language-perception interactions. In the second half of the course, students will conduct a mini-study on interactions between language and vision, language and audition, or language and number, the results of which they will present at the end of the semester. An in-depth focus on the development of speech perception will be used as a test case for discussions about the direction of influence between language and cognition/perception. Interactions between mind and language in extreme scenarios will also be addressed.
