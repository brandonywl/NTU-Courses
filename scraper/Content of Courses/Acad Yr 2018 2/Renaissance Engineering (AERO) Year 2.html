This course will emphasize on the fundamentals of materials science and engineering that are related to various types of aerospace materials and the understanding on the processing-microstructure-property relation of these materials. This course will pay particular attention to the issues of why different materials are used for different parts of the aircrafts, their manufacturing processes and what are the challenges involved, why these materials fail and how to avoid their failures, as well as how to enhance the performance of these materials for better performance of the aircrafts. In order to understand these topics, fundamental knowledge related to microstructures and their formation as a result of processing history, strengthening mechanisms and related basic knowledge, various failure modes, and various manufacturing processes (casting, machining, forming and joining) including their salient features and limitations will be studied.
