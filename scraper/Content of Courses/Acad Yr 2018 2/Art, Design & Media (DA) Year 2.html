Centering around a two week travel experience this course will explore the boundaries of location photography. Lectures, readings and discussions prior to travel will provide technical and creative support for location projects. Ethical issues surrounding photographic representation and production will be presented and discussed. 
The students may mediate their photographic response to the location through such genres as documentary, portraiture and landscape. A strong emphasis on establishing a personal position to the particulars of the location is a core component to this class.
Whilst on location the students will be required to keep written journals detailing an informed account of all that they do. 
Towards the end of the course the student will print, mount, curate and prepare for a group exhibition of selected work. This course is best suited for students who have a sense of adventure and strong interest in other cultures.

This course focuses on connecting the worlds of objects, experiences and meanings through a conceptual framework. It introduces the student to the importance of juxtaposing new and contradictory design situations with the task of understanding and resolving them. Subjects are examined through a conceptual lens: studying different aspects of semantics, imagery, perception, behaviour, beliefs, culture as structural frameworks in the development of ideas. Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.

Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process:
The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.

Design as Discourse/ Critical Design:
You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

Conceptual Design projects:
You will apply conceptual and critical design methods to realize design projects based on various themes.

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

What is visual communication?
This course introduces you to an overview of key concepts and theories around the practice of Visual Communications. You will explore the creation, distribution, reception and consumption of messages and the influence of visual language. You will also be introduced to the roles that visual communication has within society.

Elements of Design: Form & Image -
An investigation of semiotics and the theoretical principles that underpin how meaning is extracted from words and images. Investigation covers the relationship between the sign and the signifier and how to choose appropriate signs for communicating visually through metaphor, metonym, synecdoche and juxtaposition. 

Elements of Design: Colour - 
Through analysis of a variety of examples from design outcomes, you will learn about the role of colour in communicating a message. Basic concepts of colour and meaning will be explored as elements of visual strategies.

Design Fundamentals: Layout (Single page and Multiple Folds in a single page) -
Through analysis of a variety of examples from design outcomes, you will learn techniques of composition and layout to present visual and textual elements in an effective manner on a single page. Basic introduction of page anatomy, visual dynamics, visual composition and visual hierarchy will be established between image and text. 

Ideation techniques and process documentation -
Introduction to mind mapping, mood boarding and precedence studies will be established to enable you to contextualize your design solutions within the larger practice of design. 

Class assignments -
Three creative projects.
1.	Graphic Form (Within A4):
Create a series of graphic forms within A4 to communicate a single idea using effective techniques of representation and design fundamentals.

2.	Poster Design (Within A2):
Create an A2 graphic driven poster design to communicate a single idea within a single page. Explorations on creating visual interest, visual hierarchy and visual flow within the integration of image, text and colour will be developed.

3.	Multiple Folds Single Page Print (Within A3):
Create a multiple fold print within A3 to communicate a single idea applying visual interest, visual hierarchy and visual flow.

Typography Design II provides the opportunity to develop effective and innovative typographic practice, an indispensable foundation for other visual communication courses. You will examine the essential function that typography plays and develop the necessary skills and techniques to use typography in the support of effective visual communication.
Through lectures, in-class demonstrations, discussions, comprehensive projects and critiques, you will develop and apply principles of typography such as typographic identification, composition, layout, form, hierarchy, application to multi-page layout, and the enhancement of meaning and content.
Assignments are focused on applying and exploring the application of typography adhering to aesthetic and theoretical principles. The assignments allow you to focus on meaning, style and functionality as equal collaborators in effective typographic communication. Projects are intermediate to advanced in level and develop your existing skills in a systematic way throughout the semester. Essential components of this course include research, conceptual development, verbal articulation of visual solutions, production, and visual, verbal and written presentation. Typography Design II also includes the consideration of multiple languages and cultures.

1.	The Design Process:
Design processes introduces to students various design development processes to serve as frameworks to guide and enable them to discover, define, and develop their design solutions. Student will learn about the different approaches, techniques and considerations at key points in the design process.

2.	Design Research Techniques:
Various user-research techniques such as role-playing, focus group, visual methods will be introduced to enable them to gain insight to the opinions, experience, preference and tastes of a specific audience. Alongside a series of seminars, this section will also include in-class activities on the various techniques.

3.	Visualising Data:
Visualising data introduces students to various forms of data visualisation and discusses the characteristics, benefits and key considerations when treating information visually.   

4.	Design Contexts:

Students to summarise and present their research information and findings through a visual graphic format. 
2.	Design Context 1:
Explore and develop appropriate and effective communication design solution using a suitable choice of media for a specific audience as a respond to a particular contemporary societal issue. Design solution may take form as a design enterprise, a service, a campaign or a product involving any of the format:
-	Prints e.g. Brochures, posters, publications.
-	Prototypes e.g. Packaging, objects
-	Time-Based Design e.g. Motion Graphics, Video
-	Digital Media Design e.g. Web content, Mobile application 
-	Spatial/ Experiential Design
3.	Design Context 2:
Explore and develop appropriate and effective communication design solution using a suitable choice of media for a specific audience as a respond to a particular contemporary societal issue.The choice of media chosen here should be different from Design Context 1 but offer a good sense of integration, where the media complements or synergises each other. Format:
-	Prints e.g. Brochures, posters, publications.
-	Prototypes e.g. Packaging, objects
-	Time-Based Design e.g. Motion Graphics, Video
