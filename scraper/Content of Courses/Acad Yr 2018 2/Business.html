The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.

This is a second year course for undergraduate business students specializing in banking and finance. It is mandatory for all banking and finance students except ACBS students specializing in banking and finance. It is optional for non-finance business students.

The course aims to provide participants with an understanding of the use of financial statement information from a user perspective such as equity investor, debt holder, financial analyst and manager. The course examines the impact of different accounting choices on reported earnings, shareholders? equity, cash flow and various measures of corporate performance.  Participants will develop skills in analysing financial statements for investment, credit and other business decisions. In view of the considerable similarities among US Financial Reporting Standards (US GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (FRS) for most of the topics covered in this course, we will focus on FRS in this course. Main differences between FRS and IFRS (and/or US GAAP) will be highlighted where appropriate.

Many companies engage in cross-border business and they face important financial questions beyond those found in a purely domestic setting.  This course aims at providing the necessary understanding and tools to evaluate, finance, and manage international business.   The issues and tools discuss are particularly relevant in the context of a country like Singapore which is a small and highly open economy.  All Singapore companies have to somehow engage in international business.

The course will first explain the global financial markets that facilitate international business and explain the key economic linkages among them.  In the context of international finance, understanding foreign exchange rates is crucial. Therefore, this course will also explain exchange rates and those factors that affect the rates. We then examine the challenges for companies created by unexpected changes in exchange rates. We also discuss how, if at all, these firms should manage their exposure to currency fluctuations. 

Next, we explore the traditional areas of corporate finance including capital budgeting, cost of capital and financial structure from the perspective of multinational companies. 

The recent financial crisis and other contemporary global financial issues will also be explored.

Financial derivatives have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past two decades.
However, there remain disagreements about the merits of derivatives. For example, Alan
Greenspan, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, believes that derivatives
increase financial stability; whereas Warren Buffet, the famed investor, asserts that
derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.

This course helps students to gain better understandings of derivatives and introduces
students to the usages and valuations of derivatives such as options, forward and futures
contracts.

This course is designed to help students understand and implement techniques that underlie research on the management of human resources in organizations. Research plays an integral role in the management of people in today's organizations. Companies value talent with the skills to apply scientific research practices to help improve employee productivity and well-being. Similarly, many organizations also engage external consultants to help solve problems with their workforce via research. This course will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function as both internal and external research consultants. The course begins with discussions of the principles of scientific research, and how they can be applied in a HR context. We then progress to cover the various aspects of designing research to investigate HR-related issues. Students will then learn to use statistical analysis to inform understanding of HR phenomena. The course finally ends with discussions and activities designed to help students report and present research findings.

This course is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current law for the protection of electronic information and electronic content as forms of property. Conversely this course also looks at the potential liability for misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. 

The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis,  interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with trademarks and brands embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works. This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in IP law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication ? or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Market intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting both internal and external sources of marketing information so as to enable the company to better understand the market environment in which it competes, thus equipping managers with the timely knowledge to make well-informed marketing decisions in a dynamic environment. Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the center of firms' decision making. This course helps students to understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing.  In addition, a strong relational approach is used in oppose to a transactional view of marketing.  Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions. Due to the limitation of the course duration, it is impossible to provide a how-to for managing all these relationships. Instead the course looks closer into the topic of customer relationship management and provides students with the tools and techniques to effectively use CRM.

Singapore is a small nation state with limited market opportunities. Many multinational companies have their regional headquarters in Singapore and many local companies are looking to expand overseas. This course aims to address your needs and aspirations as a marketing graduate in this globally connected world. A regional or global role will open up many career options for you and help you grow as a marketing professional. 

The first half of the course will cover familiar topics like marketing research and customer-driven marketing strategy from a global perspective. There are additional challenges that companies will face in a global context. The course will challenge your preexisting assumptions about how marketing works and help you navigate all these additional complexities of global marketing. As it is a course targeted at final-year marketing students, you will also be introduced to current concepts and ideas (e.g., design thinking) relevant to the industry to help you ease into the dynamic world of marketing. The course will also delve into how technology is transforming how companies market their products and services across borders. The first half of the course will provide grounding for the second part of the course. 

The second half of this course will seek to address the global marketing challenges facing Asian companies, and why they must learn to become global marketing/business competitors. In particular, it seeks to provide students with some insightful perspectives on how Asian companies can begin on their journeys to become global competitors. Asian companies must learn to adapt to the fast-changing rules of global competition, when many of these rules are enacted by the West. The recent sagas against Chinese companies on toys, milk products, textiles and other related products are examples for Asian companies to realize that they cannot operate independently of international opinions, norms, and sensitivities. Without a doubt, Asian companies must continue to improve their management and learn to strategize better to effectively deal with the West. They need to improve their global competitiveness, learn to build world-class businesses and brands, and how to establish sustainable global companies in order to rival the Western multi-national corporations. There will be a couple of sessions in which you will be exposed to how Sun Zi Bingfa can be applied to global business strategies. Given the rising economic power of China, Sun Zi Bingfa can provide a useful insight into the mind of the Chinese corporate strategist.

The objective of this course is to expose non-accounting and non-business students to the environment of accounting and its role in providing information for useful decision making by various stakeholders of business organizations. By the end of the course, students should be able to appreciate the role, scope and value of information for managing business organizations towards achieving their goals.

Students will learn fundamental concepts and techniques in financial and managerial accounting through solving business problems.

This is an introductory course in finance for non-business and non-accounting students, which provides students with a broad understanding of the principles and practice of Business Finance/Financial Management.   The emphasis is on the major financial decisions made by companies and the valuation of investments made by them.  The course starts by examining the various forms of businesses and the importance of interest rates.  Time value of money, and the linkage between risk and return, lays the foundation for evaluating the price of bonds and stocks.  Students will learn and apply principles of capital budgeting (calculating the profitability of various projects and deciding which one to proceed) and capital structure (financing approved projects by issuing shares or bonds, or using retained earnings).  The decision to use extra cash to pay dividends or repurchase shares will be analysed and the course concludes with the use of derivatives to protect and enhance the value of firms.

Students intending to take this course should be numerate (good and comfortable with mathematical calculations and formulas) e.g. they should know well compound interest calculations, Sum of Geometric Progression (G.P.) calculation before attending this course.

Practical Ethics' is a course for students who want to make sense of the idea of right and wrong in a commonsense and practical way that relates to the world we live in (especially in the business context) that is informed by a firm introduction to the main ideas of some of the most important ethical theories.

The first half of the course is an introduction to the elements of ethical reasoning and the main branches of ethical theories and some of their chief modern proponents.  This lays the groundwork for the second half: which will critically apply these concepts thus examined to a consideration of the role of law and ethics in some of the paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  These may include:  corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and child labour (people), international business and public corruption, and environmental sustainability (planet). The seminars will be structured around problems (hypothethical and real) and possibly a few video clips for discussions which are intended to be interesting and engaging whilst providing the context for a serious inquiry into the issues.  Leaders of all kinds, especially those of businesses, are expected in today?s world to be sensitive to ethical dimensions of our reality. This course aims to provide the foundation for such ethical understanding and thinking.

The assessment will be based entirely on coursework: participation, presentation, and a written assignment. There are no prerequisites for the course.

NOTE: "Prospective students should take note that this is a participation intensive course intended for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. Students not prepared to undertake this are not expected to do well.?

This course is designed for students who have chosen to specialise in disciplines other than business. As students may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is rather useful wherever their career takes them. We will discuss the basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its practice and how this understanding could potentially enhance the students' future performance in their chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected of students and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, lead discussions and present your analysis and recommendations on selected organisations.

Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.

This course is concerned with the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication activities.  The course primarily takes the marketer's perspective, requiring you to consider and critically evaluate factors influencing both the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated marketing communication (IMC) programs.  In this course, we regard IMC as a system of thinking, processes and coordinated activities driven by the marketer's objectives. Adopting a global perspective, we draw illustrative examples and cases from different parts of the world and discuss issues faced by marketers in conducting IMC programs across countries. 

The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.

Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.  While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

The health, beauty, and wellness industry is predicted to have a strong growth in the coming years. With the disposable income and life expectancy increasing, many consumers are willing to spend considerable amount of income on seeking and keeping health and beauty. Healthy lifestyle has become a global trend with many health conscious followers. With the growing ageing population around the world, high quality healthcare services that provides patients a pleasant experience are in great demand. This course will provide an overview of conducting marketing in three sectors of the growing health industry: 1. Consumer health and beauty products/services (e.g. healthy foods, gym membership, sports apparel, slimming treatment services); 2. Healthcare services (e.g. services in hospitals, clinics, senior-living communities, pharmacies); and 3. Health and wellness tourism (e.g. travel for medical exam, medical spa, spiritual experiences, mind-body connection). The business environment of these sectors will be reviewed. Current trends, opportunities and challenges will be highlighted to help students learn and practice how to develop marketing strategy in these sectors. On the other hand, students as consumers will gain insights into their own pursuit of health, beauty, and wellness with a deeper understanding of the business landscapes of these sectors. Fundamental marketing concepts, principles, and frameworks will be reviewed to ensure that non-business students are also equipped with necessary marketing knowledge to work on the course assignments and projects.

To function in an organisation, technical skills by themselves are insufficient; they have to be supplemented by management training.  Success in an organisation depends as much on general management skills and understanding operational systems as on technical expertise.  Hence, students need a firm foundation in management skills.  This course is designed for non-business students and aims to equip them with the knowledge, skills and competence in various aspects of management, including: the role of management and managers; decision-making, planning and strategy; managing organisational architecture; managing individuals and groups; and controlling critical organisational processes.

The course covers some important non-textbook principles for organizational leadership, with an emphasis on both and "eastern" and "western" approaches to leadership.
 
You will learn practical skills and techniques for networking, teamworking, managing and leading people at work (eg., setting goals, delegating work, conducting a staff meeting, coaching employees, impressing various stakeholders).
 
The assessment will actually be fun and will provide further learning for you! It involves a real world project, some independent research into leadership concepts, and self-reflection on your own leadership style.
 
Weekly seminars will involve lots of discussions, roleplays, and group activities, so be prepared to experience many aspects of leadership for real!

1. What is the course trying to achieve? (Purpose)
Using theories and evidence based on psychology, behavioral economics and decision
neuroscience, this course aims to help you understand the decision making processes and
especially the typical errors and biases that influence choice behavior. Armed with this
knowledge , you will be able to (i) understand and improve your own decision making abilities, (ii) understand the decision making of other stakeholders such as consumers, policy makers, patients, managers and (ii) improve and design services, strategies and policies that influence your target audiences.
2. Why should someone take this course e.g. future career, future course, etc.? (Value)
The first reason is to understand the decision making processes of various stakeholders ?
consumers, entrepreneurs, managers, public, accountants. The second reason is to help you
improve your own decision making abilities ? one of the most critical skills for the future
managers, professionals, doctors, and accountants. Finally, different companies and organizations have established behavioral units that employ the principles taught in this course to improve their services and functions. Both companies as well as governmental organizations have been actively adopting the principles of Behavioral Decision Science. This shows the importance of understanding human behavior in the design of services, strategies and policies.

This course is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current law for the protection of electronic information and electronic content as forms of property. Conversely this course also looks at the potential liability for misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. 

The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis,  interactive web-pages and video sharing ? where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with trademarks and brands embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works. This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in IP law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication ? or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.
