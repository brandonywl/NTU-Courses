This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world?s population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

Like so many other aspects of life, language communication has been revolutionised by the introduction of the Internet. This course explores how the structure and use of English have been shaped by the popularity of new modes of communication made available by the Internet: SMS, e-mail, chatrooms, Internet Relay Chat, Usenet newsgroups, World Wide Web pages, and virtual worlds. The implications of these changes for our thinking and understanding of language will also be discussed.

This course is designed to provide a theoretical frame and language reconstruction training in Toponymy and Toponomastics, both at the level of the historical reconstruction of the origins and original meanings of place names all over the world (in different historical and geographical contexts) and in the evaluation of the relations between Toponymy and human societies. Students will be provided with an overall view on the study of Diachronic Toponymy (undocumented and endangered linguistic contexts) and Historical Toponomastics (linguistic contexts with available historical sources and records) and on their relevance in the reconstruction of proto-languages and in hypothesizing the existence of pre-languages.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

The course explores the interaction of language and culture from linguistic, sociological and anthropological points of view. Using linguistic and social theories as a basis, this course will demonstrate how the treatment of language and culture issues might pose a danger of propagating stereotypes. It will also question the transference and translation of languages across cultures. Pragmatic theories will be also used to explain the causes of cross-cultural misunderstandings. Other topics discussed include the role of prosody and nonverbal behaviour in communication; factors influencing conversational style in different discourse contexts; the negotiation of power and solidarity in intercultural communication; the socialisation of language, and the creation of an identity from a child language acquisition perspective.

This course begins with a consideration of the history of the field of study. This is followed by a discussion of the methods used in current research, including concepts and techniques from a variety of disciplines: primatology, archaeology, paleontology, anthropology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and child language acquisition. A review of major theories that have been put forward in recent years to explain how language might have evolved from earlier forms of representation and communication will then be given. This includes Pinker's language instinct theory, Gould's `spandrel theory', Lieberman's speech theory, Dunbar's `gossip theory', Deacon's language-brain co-evolution theory and others.

In this course we will examine how language is represented and learnt in the brain.  Cutting-edge findings from state of the art techniques using functional neuroimaging and lesion studies will be reviewed to enable students to understand the workings of the human brain in relation to language use. Specific aspects of language processing such as meaning representation, speech perception and learning, learning disabilities as well as the bilingual brain will be introduced. Basic neuroanatomy will also be covered to enable students to pursue further studies. This course introduces functional neuroimaging at an advanced level.

The course will focus on critical topics that affect multilingual individuals in multilingual communities across the lifespan. The approach is interdisciplinary as the readings will be drawn from psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and education. The students will read advanced theoretical discussion of multilingualism as a phenomenon and reflect on why the current research scope needs to be extended to include multilinguals and not just bilinguals. The primary focus of the course is on evaluating how multilingualism alters our perception of the world from a cognitive perspective. However, the importance of social contexts and its modulating impact on cognition will be a central theme in this course. The readings will also be geared towards an in depth understanding of the methodological concerns in the field.. 

At the end of the course, students will be more able to ask incisive questions relevant to the field and develop a topic for research. Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to pursue their own data collection for their own independent research in a multilingual context.

The course considers the socio-cultural and linguistic factors involved in language maintenance, shift, loss and revival from a societal, community and government perspective. The main emphasis is on understanding the range of complex individual and community based communicative and interactional settings and processes involved in the processes. The secondary focus of this course is to understand the governments' political and ideological role in language maintenance, shift, loss and revival. The course also considers ways communities and governments can cooperate to achieve shared language objectives.

This course begins with an introduction to an empirical approach to language description and comparison frorn a cognitive perspective, plus introduction to information structure concepts, which fundamental to understanding language structure. A range of linguistic forms and functions are then compared and contrasted systematically at different levels of analysis, attempting to highlight the cognitive differences in the mindsets of the speakers (how they cut up or "chunk" their experiences and represent them in language forms) that lead to the languages manifesting different patterns.

Using materials from Mainland and Island Southeast Asia, the course will have two main themes:
 
Language-external: (a) The region?s array of languages examined historically and sociolinguistically. (b) The use of linguistic data in uncovering the region?s social and cultural history. (c) Language-change and language-loss in the face of present-day political pressures. (d) Language-engineering in the region?s nation-states. 

Language-internal: (a) Critical discussion of the various theoretical approaches to language-and-culture issues, both old and new, especially as presented in the literature of linguistic anthropology. (b) Discussion of the extent to which the organisation (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) of languages relates to their cultural and social contexts in which they are spoken.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

This course is a continuation of the previous two Arabic courses offered by CML.  The course consolidates and extends the skills acquired on Arabic Language Levels 1 and 2 (ie, LA9001 and LA9002 respectively).  In this course, the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LA9002 are strengthened and expanded, enabling students to express themselves better in their written and oral expressions using the past, present and future tenses.  The course will enable learners to use Modern Standard Arabic in various real life situations and further enhance their ability in the four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The course teaches students to express themselves effectively in everyday communicative interactions beyond basic survival requirements.  It enables students to use a range of complex phrases and sentence structures as well as build on their vocabulary and idiomatic expressions.  It also further develops students' ability in reading and writing in the Arabic writing system so that they can successfully read and write.  Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex audio and written texts.

This German course is a continuation of the previous three courses offered by CML. In this course the fourth case (Genitive) is introduced and the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LG9003 are strengthened and expanded, enabling extensive written and oral expression in past, present and future tenses. Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex texts (reading and listening), which will enable a more complex and diverse understanding and use of the language in a variety of daily situations and discussions. 

Although the course develops all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) a special emphasis is placed on the active language production, especially the oral aspect. Audio-visual materials are used extensively and German is used almost exclusively as the language of instruction in the classroom.  

This course is equivalent to Level A2.2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and it prepares students to sit for the official external examination Start Deutsch 2 (SD2). The examination is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the German Language, issued and recognized by the German government and conducted at the Goethe Institut Singapur.

This course is a progression from the Level 2 course. In this course, students are introduced to a more advanced level of sentence construction and patterns.  These are taught through the exploration of interesting and current topics of interest, which provide a stimulus to conversation.  Learners' language competency will be enhanced through drills and practices, using a guided imitation method followed by situational applications to enable immediate practical usage.  Through the introduction of formal and informal expressions, students will have a deeper understanding of the more complex Japanese social practices where the mode of speech is determined by corresponding variations in human relationships and behaviour.  Students are exposed to more sophisticated dialogues recorded for listening practice with question drills to familiarize them to native-spoken Japanese.  An addition of approximately 330 words, 30 sentence patterns and 60 kanji characters will be covered in the syllabus.
