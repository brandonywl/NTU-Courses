From the invention of the ploughshare to the rise of the Internet, technological advancement makes an impact on economic organisation, social relations, and cultural life. In developing this central theme, this course begins with an understanding of the rise of science as a social institution and as a predominant form of rationality. In addition to understanding basic shifts in the experience of time and space brought about by scientific and technological advances, the course considers specific changes in the way that people live, learn, work and play. The human and social consequences  benefits and costs  of the impact of such advances are also examined.

Rapid advancement in science and technology presents individuals and societies with a unprecedented array of challenges. This course explores the social, ethical and policy issues associated with scientific and technological advancement by posing questions such as the following: What is science? How is scientific knowledge created, disseminated and adopted? How are discoveries and inventions made and accepted? What is the nature of scientific and technological progress? How is it influenced by social, political, economic and cultural factors? What are the roles of universities, research institutes and industrial or business partners? In examining the social implications and consequences of the new scientific ideas and technological applications, the course scrutinizes developments in multiple fields, including the life sciences, medicine, engineering and digital media.

This course is designed with the aim of enabling Arts and Humanities students to carefully research and analyze texts, reflect on them, and write disciplinarily appropriate essays.  The basic premise of the course is that effective writing in the Arts and Humanities is based on excellent, informed, and interdisciplinary analysis of original texts.  Students will be exposed to a variety of primary texts from their own discipline, as well as those of other disciplines in the Arts and Humanities, and taught how to approach and analyze them.  They will furthermore be taught how to incorporate and use arguments from secondary sources, how to develop strong research questions, and how to research and put together a strong research paper. Throughout, the course emphasizes a consideration of the how other disciplines contribute to research in their own discipline.

What's proper reasoning and how do you tell whether an argument is good or bad? This class introduces you to formal logic, a set of powerful tools that allow us to give precise answers to the preceding questions. Along the way we will also discuss a few paradoxes - for example, how should we understand and evaluate claims about objects that don't exist, such as the claim that Santa Clause lives on the North Pole?

What is the right thing to do? What is the fundamental nature of the universe? Are there limits to knowledge? These questions, which we continue to ask today, were also pondered and debated by philosophers over two thousand years ago, and in trying to answer them, they developed sophisticated systems of thought. This course aims to teach students the
views of the highly influential philosophers of ancient Greece, Rome, and other regions of the ancient world. The main philosophers covered will be Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and some of the Pre-Socratics. The course is structured around several topics, including ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

The first half of the module examines the following question: What are race and gender? We begin by examining ?commonsense? (i.e., non-academic) concepts of race and gender that have been influential both historically and into the present day.  The shortcomings of the commonsense views of race and gender then provide a segue into an examination of attempts by scholars from a variety of disciplines to provide more adequate definitions of race and gender.  One major category of proposals state that race and gender are socially constructed categories.  Another major category of proposals says that concepts of race and gender can be grounded in biology, albeit in a different way that the ?commonsense? view claims.  Strengths and weaknesses of each of these proposals are examined.

The second half of the module builds on the first half by examining the social, political, and ethical dimensions of race and gender.  One overarching topic concerns the relationship between race/gender and inequality, as well as arguments for and against proposals such as affirmative action that are intended to remedy racial/gender inequalities.  Another major topic is the role that race and gender plays in shaping our social and political institutions, with specific sub-topics including race/gender and political representation as well as the role of race and gender in the criminal justice system.  A third topic is the psychology of race and gender, with particular attention to the ways in which stereotypes can (often unconsciously) shape our interactions and expectations.  The final topic is intersectionality, a theoretical framework for examining the ways in which race, gender, and other social categories interact to shape individual experiences.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?
