Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

Consisting of a series of lectures, film viewings and workshops, Documentary Filmmaking explores the different t genres and practices of the cinematic non-fiction film form. The course covers a brief history and theory of the documentary as political propaganda, investigative essay, personal journal, and cinema verite observation, through the study of documentary auteurs. You will develop an understanding of the ethical precepts, as well as an appreciation of the aesthetics and intellectual rigour of the documentary form. 

Through practice, you will be exposed to the fundamentals of documentary filmmaking. The course seeks to develop your ability to identify, conceptualise and research a topic, negotiate access to characters or events, manage a production through efficient budgeting and scheduling, and create a short non-fiction cinematic narrative with coherent artistic vision and intellectual purpose. 

Assessment will take the form of:

Documentary Film project 
Working in groups of 2, teams will write, shoot, direct and edit a video documentary. You may shoot no more than 60 minutes of video per group and the finished films should be 4-6 minutes long, complete with titles and credits. Includes oral pitches. The films are to submitted as self-contained MOV files.  

Continuous Assessment
Continuous assessment components include both written and studio-based exercises.

What is Sound?
Overview of the physics of sound and psychoacoustics. How we hear; frequency, amplitude, pitched and non-pitched sounds. Noise and types of noise. Listening to sound and developing a vocabulary to discuss it critically.

Microphones:
An investigation into the properties and operating principles of modern microphones. What the various types of microphone are and how we chose the best one for a particular application. Inverse square law, phase cancellation and proximity effect as related to the use of microphones.

Production Sound Recording:
Single and Dual system recording is explored in the context of recording dialog for fiction and non-fiction films. Location mixers, recorders, laviller and shotgun microphones will be examined and utilised in practical exercises. Correct protocols and techniques for on set dialog recording will investigated with a consideration of the aesthetics of dialog recording. Critical listening to identify and correct sound recording errors will be developed.

Post Production:
Delivering production sound to the editor including correct sound coverage and a complete sound report will be explored. Synchronising sound and image in picture editing software and exporting  sound and image from this software using the correct output formats. Basics of editing sound in audio editing software with an emphasis on understanding how production recording influences post production sound editing. Post production processing techniques including noise reduction, compression and EQ will be introduced and examined.

Class assignments:
There are four in class dialog recording assignments that explore various shooting scenarios and recording systems. The final 2 assignments include a dialogue editing component. There will also be 2 in class quizzes covering more theoretical aspects of sound, sound recording and post production.

This is an entry-level course that focuses on creation of films that allow experimentation in various stages of filmmaking processes, including the development of various alternate forms of (non) narrative story structures. You will be exposed to a range of conceptual and production strategies in experimental film using key historical and contemporary examples and then put those ideas into practice through exercises and projects in order to develop your own experimental film practice. Experience and knowledge gained in this module will provide a basis for further more developed experimental film production, as well as complementing research into this field.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

This course introduces students to the different genres of contemporary popular global cinemas. In addition to Hollywood feature films, students will study non-Hollywood contemporary films that have proven successfully at the box offices either internationally and/or in their countries of production in order to study the critical elements that have contributed to the success of these films. Students will be exposed to box office hits from a wide variety of countries such as Spain, the UK, Japan, Korea, India and Australia. The analysis of these popular films will be contextualised in relation to relevant film theories such as genre theory, audience reception theories, studies of the economic development of new cinematic industries and the impact of global film distribution.

This course aims to introduce you to the martial arts cinemas of Asia. You will study classical and contemporary films produced by East Asian cinemas (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea), allowing you to become acquainted with the historical, institutional and cultural contexts behind these films. You will be introduced to a wide variety of Asian cinematic styles and they will learn the richness and diversity of regional film cultures as well as the respective societies of the countries featured. Due to the wide range of films and countries covered in this course, you are encouraged to view each lecture as a critical introduction to pertinent critical issues within each national cinema rather than a comprehensive overview of each film culture. Therefore, you are expected to use the various lectures as starting points for more in-depth research on particular films and national cultures. 
This course introduces a range of Asian cinemas and specific films in the genre of martial arts cinema to foster awareness and intercultural communication.
1.	Generic analysis of films from the prism of intercultural awareness
2.	Application of knowledge through discussions and tests of study cases

The module is desgined to teach you how to analyse films as depositories of serious content, dealing with social problems and current affairs. The films shown will cover a range of genres including action-adventure, satirical, semi-documentary, as well as documentary. You will address the question of how film relates to society and deals with pressing issues of current concern.
Each week the course will introduce a key film to be watched by the students in class. This will be followed by a brief lecture and discussion, seminar style. You will be required to assess the weekly reading pertinent to the specific topic introduced each week. Films to be viewed and discussed will include Battle of Algiers (Italy/Algeria, 1966), Walker (USA, 2013), The President?s Last Bang (South Korea, 2005), Zero Dark Thirty (USA, 2012), The Unknown Known (USA, 2013), American Sniper (USA, 2014), etc. There will be quizzes and a test undertaken in a specific week designed to assess how you have kept up in their knowledge of the films and the issues involved. A set of core readings will be required for all students to master; and there will be a test and discussion of your understanding of the principles and theories in these core readings.

This course considers the manner in which art responds to war, and the ways in which war and violence are appropriated in both aesthetic and critical discourse. We will examine the centrality of war to human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to:

	the structural constitution of war
	the differences and similarities between war and violence
	the inherent ambivalence of war
	semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war
	artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture
	Just War or just war?
	visual vs textual representations

This course is about more than just literature adaptations. In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature.
This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature. You will learn to analyze film adaptations and assess their impact on the reception of the source texts. It develops your skills in close reading, trains you in the theory and practice of adaptation, and enhances your knowledge and understanding of genre. Please refer to the planned weekly schedule for a specific list of topics.
