The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in film practice. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their immediate relevance to film practice in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire any necessary skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and possible solution.

Finally, you will present your response, describing your analysis, strategy, process, which will move toward your proposed film project.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the response. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Project Presentation and handin.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

This course is a practical course that focuses on learning techniques and processes to create digital 3d models. There are two main types of digital modelling ? constructed and sculpted. Both approaches will be learned and explored as to their suitability for a range of outcomes. A wide range of mechanical and organic shapes will be developed, using a variety of techniques and level of detail. Surface colouring and lighting will be examined, as well as other surface attributes such as reflectivity, shininess, dullness, glow, wetness, as well as some discussion into complex surface textures such as hair.

The course will also cover a range of export and linking options in order to integrate into  a production scenario for animation, special effects, cinema or digital gaming.

You will be introduced to the storyboard as a thinking tool, through which creative ideas are developed and given detail. You will learn to employ artistic tools like framing, camera movement, character movement and key visuals within the larger structure of the entire narrative. The role of the storyboard within the animation pipeline and its relevance to concept development, script development, animatics and production design will be covered. The course will focus partucularly focus on the aspects of animation production design that support the dramatic impact of the story. Further insight will be gained of the connection between visual development and storyboard through exercises and assignments on character design, environment and prop design.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

This course will develop upon the skills that the student learned in DT3002. They will also be introduced to advanced techniques of content generation and be able to create such things as fire, water, cloth and to subject them to real-world dynamic forces. The students will refine their knowledge of the physical and optical qualities of the real world and how they can be simulated within a constructed filmic environment.

Visual report study:
Theoretical and practical analysis of printed media that allow visualizing stories effectively in accordance to a specific target audience. Visual reports will be examined throughout a wide range of case studies. 

Special-interest publication analysis:
By means of an investigation on special interest publications, its history and function, you will understand how to express the identity of particular groups through your own voice. 

The need for publishing and the choice of media:
You will analyze the stories to be published. You will consequently develop your own approach to communicate them. Parallel to the former, there will be a reflection on the choice of media selected for publishing. 

Editorial design as a communication strategy:
From idea generation to publishing, you will be able to comprehend and cohesively plan an editorial project. 

Assignments and exercises:
Project 1: Exercises that test ability to engage in an editorial design project. 

Project 2: Intermediary assignment that introduces theory and practice regarding designing for print or digital environments with multiples levels of information across one or more editions.

Project 3: Advanced final project that integrates all theory and practice-based learning acquired during the course. The main objective of this project is to understand the editorial design production process.
