This 13-week programme provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in the development and regulation of healthcare products. The main area of concentration is in medical devices and is divided into four parts. The course begins with a historical introduction into the healthcare products industry and the start of regulatory controls. It then moves into the core principles of healthcare products regulations and expands into the methodologies of ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes going through the fundamentals of Good Manufacturing Practices, quality management systems, product risk classification, risk management and the different regulatory systems in the world. At the end of this course, you should have a clear understanding of healthcare products regulations and able to apply these requirements in product development. You will also be required to perform casework to test their ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios.

In this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding and will become conversant in the applications of several critical spectroscopy techniques to Structural Biology. Mainly through X-ray diffraction of crystals (XRD), but also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Microscopy (EM), the atomic view of the biological world is continuously expanding. Although this solves many mysteries of molecular function, our understanding of structure and function often requires the use of other complementary techniques, especially those that rely on the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological molecules, i.e., spectroscopy. These spectroscopic methods provide essential insights that are not accessible by the main structural techniques (XRD, NMR or EM), in the structural analysis of biomolecules, their dynamics, protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, or the role of these biomolecules in a cellular environment. Overall, the aim is that you can use the acquired understanding of these techniques and apply it to a series of problems with examples from the literature, understanding at the same time their limitations, for their integration in your future projects. Current practice of Structural Biology is critically dependent on such integration. From a professional perspective, each of these techniques is a world in itself, and familiarity with its applications will also be useful in your future potential links with industry.

Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, consist of thousands of repeated G-rich sequences (TTAGGG in humans) decorated by DNA-binding proteins that form a telomeric capping structure called shelterin. Telomere maintenance is essential for genomic stability and cell viability. Telomere shortening correlates with cellular ageing, which limits the number of times a somatic cell can divide. In stem cells and 90% of human cancer, cell proliferation and immortalization requires activation of the telomerase enzyme. In this course, you will learn about the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase, protein and DNA interactions and cell cycle regulation of telomeric chromatin. Furthermore, the course covers telomere maintenance in cancer cells, accelerated ageing diseases, genome stability and DNA damage. The course contains introductory lectures as well as tutorials for in-depth discussions of current topics in the field.

In this one-week course you will develop skills for the preparation of tissues for histological examination and to understand normal and pathological tissue architecture using different staining procedure. You will learn the five basic steps of tissue preparation: fixation, tissue processing, sectioning, embedding and staining. These basic skills will prepare you for the BS4020 final year research project and potentially a career in a research laboratory, where histology plays an important part.

In this workshop, students will study the genetics of aging and longevity using various long-lived and short-lived worms carrying mutations of genes in the first life-extension pathway discovered in C. elegans. They will learn how the rate of aging is regulated hormonally by insulin and IGF-1 endocrine systems. Further, students will learn about the importance of protein homeostasis in aging and neurodegeneration using a worm model for polyglutamine (polyQ) disease. Students will perform assays for determining lifespan, motility, stress resistance, protein aggregation phenotype and toxicity using different biochemical, cell biology and imaging (light and fluorescent microscopy) experimental techniques. In line with Technology-Enabled Learning (TEL), the course will develop a series of video lessons or App to cover the seminars and lab experimental preview and setup for online learning. There is also plan for developing an online interactive platform to facilitate team-based learning amongst the students.

Metabolites, including lipids, are mediators of biological processes and imbalance in metabolism is associated with diverse human pathology, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration as well as infection. Targeting metabolism is an attractive approach for treatment of some of these diseases. The field of metabolomics/ lipidomics have emerged, with the goal to provide the systems-level view of the complex metabolic networks which need to be kept in check to maintain a healthy state. This one-week course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in metabolomics and lipidomics. The course will focus on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisition and analyses using classical as well as novel lipidomics and metabolomics approaches. Here, you will perform extraction and analyses of lipids/ metabolites from cells treated with various drugs to investigate the impact of these drugs on cellular metabolism. You will process and analyse the metabolomics/ lipidomics datasets using open-source software(s). The knowledge will equip you for future works on metabolism and health, as well as advance graduate studies.
