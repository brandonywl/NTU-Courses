This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

In this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding and will become conversant in the applications of several critical spectroscopy techniques to Structural Biology. Mainly through X-ray diffraction of crystals (XRD), but also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Microscopy (EM), the atomic view of the biological world is continuously expanding. Although this solves many mysteries of molecular function, our understanding of structure and function often requires the use of other complementary techniques, especially those that rely on the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological molecules, i.e., spectroscopy. These spectroscopic methods provide essential insights that are not accessible by the main structural techniques (XRD, NMR or EM), in the structural analysis of biomolecules, their dynamics, protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, or the role of these biomolecules in a cellular environment. Overall, the aim is that you can use the acquired understanding of these techniques and apply it to a series of problems with examples from the literature, understanding at the same time their limitations, for their integration in your future projects. Current practice of Structural Biology is critically dependent on such integration. From a professional perspective, each of these techniques is a world in itself, and familiarity with its applications will also be useful in your future potential links with industry.

In this module, students will be tasked to design and perform experiments to identify phenotypes of different strains of knock-out mice that are immune compromised. Students will need to have a good background in immunology (hence the pre-requisite of BS2007) for this module. At the start of each day, a seminar will be presented by the faculty in-charge to allow students to understand the rationale of the 5-day mini-project and to recap on the principles of different methods to be used. Students will then design the experiments and discuss with the faculty in-charge and teaching assistants before performing the experiments. For the experiments, students will need to isolate cells from lymphoid organs of these mice. Students will need to prepare blood smears of these cells and examine them under the microscope. Students will also need to perform immunostaining of these cells and determine their surface markers by flow cytometry analyses. In addition, students will perform ELISA assays to assess the antibody response in these mice that have been injected with antigens. PCR genotyping will also be performed on these mice. At the end of every day, students will need to collate and discuss their data with the faculty in-charge. This will be conducted in the SMART classrooms. At the end of the course, students will need to submit a report and make presentations that will be graded by the faculty in-charge.

In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

The aim of this workshop is to train students to apply proteomic strategy to biological and biomedical research. Students will use tissue and blood samples from large animal (pig and/or dog) models of ischemia heart disease to discover molecular biomarker and disease mechanism by analyzing the samples using mass spectromertry-based proteomic approach. Students won?t handle or do operation on the animal. The tissue and blood samples will be provided by a cardiac research laboratory. At the start of each day, a seminar will be presented by the faculty in-charge to allow students to understand the experiment and to learn the principles of various proteomic methods to be used. Then, the faculty in-charge and teaching assistants will teach the students how to prepare and analyze the proteomic samples, and how to apply bioinformatic tools for data analysis and interpretation. In this practical workshop, students will learn protein extraction and purification using mass spectrometry compatible buffers, shotgun proteomic sample preparation, HPLC protein separation and fractionation, hand-on mass spectrometry skills, mass spectrometry data interpretation, protein sequence database search for protein identification and post-translational modifications characterization. Students will also learn data mining to discover biomarker candidates and underlying molecular disease mechanism. At the end of every day, students will need to collate and discuss their data with the faculty in-charge. This will be conducted in the SMART classrooms. At the end of the course, students will need to submit a report and make presentations that will be graded by the faculty in-charge. As there is a limitation of the mass spectrometry instrument time for this course, the maximum class size will be constrained to 15 students.

In this workshop, students will study the genetics of aging and longevity using various long-lived and short-lived worms carrying mutations of genes in the first life-extension pathway discovered in C. elegans. They will learn how the rate of aging is regulated hormonally by insulin and IGF-1 endocrine systems. Further, students will learn about the importance of protein homeostasis in aging and neurodegeneration using a worm model for polyglutamine (polyQ) disease. Students will perform assays for determining lifespan, motility, stress resistance, protein aggregation phenotype and toxicity using different biochemical, cell biology and imaging (light and fluorescent microscopy) experimental techniques. In line with Technology-Enabled Learning (TEL), the course will develop a series of video lessons or App to cover the seminars and lab experimental preview and setup for online learning. There is also plan for developing an online interactive platform to facilitate team-based learning amongst the students.

Metabolites, including lipids, are mediators of biological processes and imbalance in metabolism is associated with diverse human pathology, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration as well as infection. Targeting metabolism is an attractive approach for treatment of some of these diseases. The field of metabolomics/ lipidomics have emerged, with the goal to provide the systems-level view of the complex metabolic networks which need to be kept in check to maintain a healthy state. This one-week course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in metabolomics and lipidomics. The course will focus on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisition and analyses using classical as well as novel lipidomics and metabolomics approaches. Here, you will perform extraction and analyses of lipids/ metabolites from cells treated with various drugs to investigate the impact of these drugs on cellular metabolism. You will process and analyse the metabolomics/ lipidomics datasets using open-source software(s). The knowledge will equip you for future works on metabolism and health, as well as advance graduate studies.

We will explore the major approaches to understanding deviations from ?normal? behaviour, including the neurobiological, behavioural, psychoanalytic, humanistic, cognitive and social/family systems approaches.  We will also look at the context within which abnormal behaviours are defined, including historical views of such phenomenon, changes in psychiatric classification and thinking in our century, and variations in symptoms, interpretations and treatment in different cultures. Apart from covering some of the major mental disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), we will also explore various treatment modalities and discuss the associated legal and ethical issues.  d in understanding mental illnesses.

Psychologists have long studied the human condition in its many manifestations of weaknesses, damages and maladaptive behaviors. Yet, the discipline of psychology must also understand and appreciate the character, strengths and virtues of human life, including those relevant to the concepts of happiness, hope, motivation, mindfulness, resilience, gratitude and compassion, all of which enable individuals to thrive and flourish, while contributing to the health and well-being of family and society. This course provides a review of the literature, research, methodology and experiential practice of Positive Psychology, as well as their applications toward personal growth and social betterment.

Decisions about what to eat and how much eat are among the most pervasive judgments and cognitions humans navigate in their daily lives. These decisions around food and subsequent eating behaviors have significant impact for health and well-being, given the rising incidences of chronic diseases associated with dietary patterns, such as obesity and type-2 diabetes. This class will cover psychological, social, and environmental processes that guide people's cognitions and behaviors related to food and eating. A major theme of the class will focus on psychosocial and non-homeostatic factors that modulate appetite, and the psychological processes that may regulate or bias one's experience of hunger and fullness. This class will adopt a holistic and integrative approach to study of these questions by examining the role of diverse contextual factors (social, cultural, economic, and evolutionary) in influencing the psychological processes regulating appetite and food intake patterns. By completing this course, students will have deeper understanding of key findings and theories related to psychological and behavioral aspects of human nutrition, ability to apply this knowledge to design studies to test their own hypotheses about eating behavior, and be equipped as more critical consumers of research pertaining to these topics. Given rising national and international priorities for addressing chronic diseases linked to dietary behavior (e.g., Singapore's War on Diabetes), this course will provide students experience for potential future involvement in organizations, initiatives, and research targeting these health issues.

Current environmental problems such as global warming, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water pollution, invasive species introductions, and human overpopulation, are largely the result of human behaviour. In this course, we will investigate the important role that psychology can play in studying and fostering sustainable behaviour in humans. The course will introduce and analyze the field of conservation psychology, illuminating the potential role of psychology in understanding human behaviour towards the environment. We will explore questions such as, does behaviour leading to environmental degradation relate to human attitudes, beliefs, and values? Do people have inherent tendencies to damage the environment? How can psychology provide insight into how to intervene and control unsustainable behaviour? We will also study people?s attitudes towards nature, and how humans interact with the natural environment. Furthermore, we will learn about techniques and programs that can promote ecologically oriented attitudes and behaviours in people. Lastly, we will learn the roles that education, human value systems, economic incentives, and policy-making, play in fostering environmentally-sustainable behaviour.

Memory is vital for defining who we are, by allowing us to base actions on knowledge gleaned from previous experiences.  It also is important for performing everyday tasks so that we can keep track of intermediate stages before a behavior is completed. Research in memory concerns more than pure storage. It also focuses on how memories are used by examining strategic selection, executive processes, and the interaction with other cognitive functions including attention, perception, and decision making. Modern research has focused on discovering the mechanisms of memory by examining the neural basis of memory.

This course is an introduction to the principles underlying educational and psychological measurement and testing. The general goals of this course are to explore the nature, problems, challenges and potential of psychology testing. The first half of the course is devoted to the foundations of psychological testing in various contexts. As part of this we examine topics such as the historical roots of psychological testing, uses of psychological tests, ethical considerations, and technical and methodological principles involved in developing and evaluating test materials. The second section of the course surveys major types of psychological tests, such as intellectual ability, educational aptitude, personality and assessment in the workplace. By the end of the course students are expected to understand the basics of test theory and test construction, and be able to critically evaluate the tests that we consider in the course which are drawn from tests commonly used in the field of psychological testing

Consumer Psychology is a course about the processes of consumption which include selection, purchasing, using, and discarding goods, services, ideas, and experiences. This course examines the implication of psychological and societal factors that affect the processes of consumption. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and environment behind consumer behavior is crucial for those students who desire to work at marketing sectors. The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand consumer insight  - the desires and necessities that are on the surface of consumers' conscious thought and the deeper, possibly unconscious motives that drive human behavior at an implicit level. To achieve this goal, students will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal and external factors that influence consumer behaviour. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every business activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.
