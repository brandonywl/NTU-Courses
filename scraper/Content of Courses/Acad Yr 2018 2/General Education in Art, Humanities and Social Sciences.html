This course introduces you to a history of 'fantasy' in Western art. The nature, concepts and practice of fantastic art is explored through a series of artistic-historical periods, movements and individuals. A diversity of notions of 'fantasy' is addressed within different socio-political and historical contexts in which they were produced. This historical survey serves as a grounding for the understanding of the fantastic genre in today's artistic and media culture, which will be of use for further studies in Western Art History, as well as illustrators and animators who wish to specialize in the genre of the `fantastic'.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

This course is a practical course that focuses on learning techniques and processes to create digital 3d models. There are two main types of digital modelling ? constructed and sculpted. Both approaches will be learned and explored as to their suitability for a range of outcomes. A wide range of mechanical and organic shapes will be developed, using a variety of techniques and level of detail. Surface colouring and lighting will be examined, as well as other surface attributes such as reflectivity, shininess, dullness, glow, wetness, as well as some discussion into complex surface textures such as hair.

The course will also cover a range of export and linking options in order to integrate into  a production scenario for animation, special effects, cinema or digital gaming.

This course mainly focuses on films produced by Chinese communities living in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. The geographical demarcation also marks the different cultural and social contexts in which the films are made and marketed at. The films selected for cultural appreciation in the course not only represent the major cultural developments and trends they have contributed to world cinema but also the intellectual meanings and emotional impact they play among Chinese and non-Chinese audiences. By exploring different varieties of Chinese cinemas, students will gain an in-depth knowledge of the societies in which they originate from and the inner and cross-cultural dialogues that preside within.
[This course is conducted in English].

The aim of this course is an appreciation of selected works of modern Chinese song lyrics since the 1970s. Readings will include literary songs, folk tunes and ballads, popular music, and schoolyard or student-written songs among others. The course will guide students in understanding the different thematic genres, narrative forms, expressive styles and creative methods of lyric writing, as well as the social and cultural contexts of the song lyrics. After completing this course, students are expected to appreciate modern Chinese song lyrics from cultural and literary perspectives, and gain a deeper understanding of modern Chinese song lyric culture. 

Note: Students who have taken LC111 should not take HC805./HC8005

This course examines the ways in which madness is interpreted in selected literature and films from late 19th century onwards. Is madness a matter of perspective, biological disorder, subversion or metaphor? We examine four possible categories: the mentally ill with self-awareness of their debilitating condition; alienated individuals deviating from societal norms; mentally unsound individuals labeled insane by experts; and individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder in enacting transgressive acts. Using close reading of literary and visual narratives, this course will discuss madness in the contexts of self-awareness, creativity, alienation and isolation, language as construct, women and representation, the institution, sexual dysfunction and violence.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

Are you OK? We often ask each other this question. We are often concerned about the psychological well-being of our family members, friends, and, most importantly ourselves. In this course, we will discuss issues concerning psychological well-being and mental health in Singapore: the early signs of not being "OK", when you might need professional help, and where you might find the appropriate help. The course will be taught by a seasoned mental health practitioner in Singapore, in collaboration with our in-house faculty members.

In today's fast-paced and competitive work environment, a student is often lost as to how and where to find jobs and how to manage one's career. This course will provide an introduction to the contemporary human resource management functions: employment, employee relations, training and development, performance systems, compensation, benefits, and human resource information systems. It is not the objective of this course to train students to be HRM managers, but to provide basic information for students to plan and manage their own careers.
