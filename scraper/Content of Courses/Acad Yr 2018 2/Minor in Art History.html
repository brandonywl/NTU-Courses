Exhibition design or narrative environments?
Exhibition environments can be enlightening, immersive, interactive, and use all kinds of media: video projections, historical objects, specimens, hands-on exhibits, innovative technologies. In this course you will explore how exhibition design is evolving, to become more engaging, participatory and more effective. You will critique the role design can play in the communication of objects, ideas and information within the exhibition environment, and how the different elements of a display effectively blend.
The course presents an overview of the key characteristics of exhibition design, definitions and use of terms, and an introduction to different types of exhibitions: permanent, temporary, travelling.

Historical overview
Looking at the evolution of exhibition design over time. Focusing on key transformations underpinning museography, the model of Universal Expositions and the development of new aesthetics through the experiments of the avant-garde movements.

Field trips to Museums and Art Galleries
Exploration of the exhibition space and articulation of the visitor experience. Analysing the elements that compose an exhibition. Through analysis of a variety of examples from museums and art exhibitions, you will learn about the role of spatial perception, navigation, object placement, graphics, media and lighting in the exhibition contexts.

Working behind an exhibition
In-depth exploration of strategies to create a display and an exhibition with a larger narrative. Through analysis of a variety of case studies, you will learn about the teams that work behind exhibitions. The concept of structuring content by layering text, graphics and media. Basic applications of graphic design, typographic standards and the integration of narrative media are explored as elements of the exhibition making process.
Presentation and discussion of various issues related to exhibition making with a particular focus on strategies of audience engagement, interpretative techniques, functionality, aesthetic and sustainability helping you to experiment and reflect on the relationship between collections, content and visitors? experience.

Essay reading, writing and discussion
These classes are dedicated to the critical discussion of issues related to exhibition making today in the context of Museums and Art Galleries. Reading, writing and discussion may include reflections on newly emerging exhibition-formats that deviate from traditional displays. It provides a basic introduction and familiarizes students with new terms and challenges in conceiving innovative exhibitions.

Class assignments
Two creative projects explore the synergies between narrative and space in exhibition.
The first consist in the creation of a display using objects to tell a story. 
-	Investigation on objects as an element of storytelling;
-	Function of the single object in the display;
-	Basic concepts of arrangement, composition, lighting and colour within a display;
-	Introduction of textual or media elements.
The second project is the creation of an exhibition for a medium size gallery. An investigation on conceptualizing, planning and representing an exhibition. 
-	Concept, storyline, zones and displays in relation to the visitor experience; 
-	Exhibition layout and circulation;
-	Collection arrangement;
-	Content layering through the introduction of textual or media elements;
-	Exhibition visualization (3D Modeling)
Both assignments are developed through lectures, tutorials, class teamwork and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

This course considers the manner in which art responds to war, and the ways in which war and violence are appropriated in both aesthetic and critical discourse. We will examine the centrality of war to human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to:

	the structural constitution of war
	the differences and similarities between war and violence
	the inherent ambivalence of war
	semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war
	artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture
	Just War or just war?
	visual vs textual representations

In The History of the Book you will explore the impact of the book as an object and a technology, from medieval manuscripts to e-readers.  You will examine examples of books from different periods, both to understand how book production changed over time and to explore broader questions about the nature of texts, their reception, and their associated communities and contexts.  By learning how books were made and used, you will gain a clearer appreciation of how culture was shaped by the development of books, and how it shaped the development of books in turn.  The archival and research skills you learn during this course will serve you in future research projects.

This course explores the influence of the book as a force in history and literature from the medieval period to the present.  It will include hands-on examination of books and manuscript fragments as well as discussion of books as objects, social forces, and vehicles for text.

This course will build on students` knowledge of the practice of history by introducing
them to classic works of historiography and the theoretical approaches, which such
works take. Each week the course will focus on one key work, which will be
contextualised in terms of its contribution to a wider historical and theoretical debate.
Approaches covered will include Marxist history, the Annales School, Historical
Sociology, the history of Nationalism, Micro-history, The Cultural Turn, Gender history,
Subaltern Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, the history of the Senses, and Oral history.
