Policy/program evaluation constitutes a key element of contemporary policymaking and refers to a comprehensive, often multi-year study of program/policy function and outcomes. This course will expose students to: 1) the complexity and scope of policy evaluation; and 2) the basic methods of policy and program evaluation. The social, political, and ethical contexts of evaluation will also be covered in the class.

Throughout the semester, we will look at evaluation examples that have been conducted on public issues, programs, and policies to demonstrate key points. We will also work through the application of fundamental evaluation concepts and techniques, and at the same time address a range of measurement issues, the basics of analysis, and reporting of performance data. Students will be exposed to a number of evaluation studies and will have hands-on experience of designing evaluation projects.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind -e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an 'identity'.Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.
