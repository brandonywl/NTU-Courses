This course introduces students to process geomorphology, sedimentology and stratigraphic principles, and provides tools for the interpretation of sediments and sedimentary rocks and basins.  Lectures in weeks 1-2 cover sediments composition, sediment transport and sedimentary structures. Lecture in week 3 introduces the facies approach to sedimentology and
geomorphology. The second phase moves to conceptualise the processes of formation, transport and deposition of sediment. During lectures in weeks 5-8 students develop conceptual models for the full range of landscapes and sedimentary environments on earth, from desert dunes to deep seas muds and coral reefs to gravel bed rivers. Lectures from weeks 8-11 introduce the concepts of sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary basin analysis. The lecture series is supplemented by 8 laboratory exercises and 2 field trips the first a half day
and the second a 4 day trip to Miri in Malaysia. The field program is a major part of the course
both in content and assessment.

This is an advanced ecology course, and as such it builds on the foundations and theory that the students will have been exposed to in ecology courses in their first two years. Because it is an advanced course, the aim is to get the students to think critically and to apply their knowledge to new and unfamiliar situations, rather than just memorize facts. As such, the students will be introduced to a series of 12 cutting edge topics including those currently under debate, and will expected to critically assess them. A large part of the course will also be to write a review or opinion article on a fast moving topic in ecology.

The first half of the course will contain a theory module where students will read about current topics and discoveries in Environmental Genomics while the second half of the course will contain a practical module where students will experience how environmental genomic data is produced and subsequently analyzed.

The goal of this course is to provide a solid foundation about the physical processes dictating ocean movements. We begin by looking at the structure of the atmosphere, the main thermodynamic principals governing water, and the properties of sea water, to formulate how these three areas influence ocean circulation. Next, we take a close look at the chemical composition of sea water and use these properties as ocean tracers to reinforce what we have learned about ocean circulation.  Finally, by combining our knowledge of ocean circulation and chemical content, we examine primarily through laboratory exercises where primary producers thrive in ocean waters.

This course will provide students with an overview of the most important concepts of atmospheric chemistry. The course will examine how atmospheric chemical species interact with other parts of the earth, and how chemical reactions in the atmosphere control their concentrations. Students will be taught how these chemical species and reactions influence both the global climate and environments.
This course introduces students to atmospheric chemistry of the upper and lower atmosphere, including related environmental and climatic issues. Lectures in weeks 1-2 introduce the evolution of the atmosphere as well as units for atmospheric chemistry. Lecture s in week 3 introduce the basic atmospheric dynamics, which are important to understand atmospheric chemistry. After introducing basic box models, it will be utilized to discuss geochemical cycles. During lectures in weeks 6-7, students will learn about the chemistry in the stratosphere. Subsequently, students will learn about the chemistry in the troposphere during weeks 8-9. Lectures in weeks 10-11introduce atmospheric aerosol particles. The relationship between atmospheric chemistry and the global climate will be discussed in week 12.Students will learn about local air quality issues in week 13.
