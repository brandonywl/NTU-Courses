The course provides a comprehensive knowledge for students to understand lexicon construction in Chinese and its connection with syntactic and phonological environment, issues in new word formation since ancient times, differentiation of synonyms and given that word sense is a function of its parts, students will also be guided to examine the semantics in Chinese lexicons as well as variation across time and geographical boundaries.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world?s population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

This course is an overview of some key issues in first language acquisition. It charts children's language development from birth right through the school years. The emphasis of the course is on evaluating crosslinguistic data against current theoretical models of language acquisition. Topics include phonological; morphological; grammatical; semantic and pragmatic development. The course will also evaluate the influence of the environment on the child's language development by examining studies on input and research on differences in socialisation patterns across languages. Students will have the opportunity to work with real language data from a variety of languages.

How do we speak the unspeakable? How do we talk about sex? Why do we talk about it the way we do? And why do we not talk about it when we don?t? Why is sex often taboo?... How do we construct our sexual subjectivities and how do we perform our sexual identities through language-in-use?... Do gays and lesbians have their own language(s)? What are the `labels? that have been applied to non-conformist sexual choices and non-heterosexual orientations throughout history? How have they changed? How and why do some of them get reclaimed and re appropriated by the very same people they were intended to offend and discriminate against? And how are some other offensive labels resisted and rejected? What are the main sociocultural and political significances of these linguistic interventions? What does language have to do with identity politics? What are the main achievements of the sexual political movements? And what are their shortcomings?... How do we verbalize our erotic desire?... How do we represent our sexuality online, and how do we construct discursively what/whom we want, or do not want?... Why are sexual jokes and innuendoes funny and/or provocative and socially disruptive even when not a single ?bad word? is used? 

These are among the questions we?ll be tackling throughout this course by examining a wide range of examples from around the world. We will critically reflect on insights and concepts from sociolinguistics, sociology, anthropology, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, literary criticism, media studies and related social sciences and humanities in order to develop an integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological toolbox which we will apply when analyzing the linguistic and discursive aspects of human sexuality. 

The course will provide ample opportunities for students to get hands-on experience by analyzing and discussing real-life language data. Students will be expected to do all the assigned readings on time, submit their reading notes and discussion questions the night before the class, and actively participate in our in-class discussions. 

Parental advisory: occasional explicit content! We will occasionally deal with ?strong language? throughout this course. The course is not suitable for those who may find such content objectionable. There will be no pornography in this course.

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

In this unit we focus on how we understand what someone is trying to communicate to us when they say or write something to us, especially how the particular words and structures are used for the purpose of getting us to understand just what the speaker intends. Given that the meaning of a word or structure depends on how it is used, we will look at the physical and cultural contexts within which communication occurs and develop an understanding of the role they play in the communication of meaning.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

Using materials from Mainland and Island Southeast Asia, the course will have two main themes:
 
Language-external: (a) The region?s array of languages examined historically and sociolinguistically. (b) The use of linguistic data in uncovering the region?s social and cultural history. (c) Language-change and language-loss in the face of present-day political pressures. (d) Language-engineering in the region?s nation-states. 

Language-internal: (a) Critical discussion of the various theoretical approaches to language-and-culture issues, both old and new, especially as presented in the literature of linguistic anthropology. (b) Discussion of the extent to which the organisation (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) of languages relates to their cultural and social contexts in which they are spoken.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

It is also the study of how internal plans are composed, maintained, and carried out.  This class will examine perception, attention, memory, language, expertise, problem solving, and reasoning. E-learning tools will be used to disseminate information related to the course and various announcements, and will also allow interaction between course participants.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind -e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an 'identity'.Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.
