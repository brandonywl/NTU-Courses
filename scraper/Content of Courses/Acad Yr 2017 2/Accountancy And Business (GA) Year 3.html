The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

Accounting plays a vital role in business organizations' strive for resources and performance. Through the provision of useful information, accounting helps organizations attract resources from external stakeholders, and helps internal stakeholders manage these resources, to achieve the targeted performance. The process not only facilitates the creation of value for organizations and their stakeholders, it also benefits the economy and society as a whole, by helping to direct resources to where they can be more productive.

Based upon the foundation established in the predecessor course AA101, this course focuses on the relevance of accounting information to internal stakeholders, i.e. management, to make decisions and achieve control in their strive for performance. Emphasis is placed on both the provision, as well as the application, of accounting information.

The purpose of this course is to help students to develop a strong conceptual foundation in accounting information systems, a necessary pre-requisite for effective performance in accountants and auditors in the current digital era. The course enables the students to understand, evaluate and use Accounting Information Systems effectively in their future roles as accountants, managers, consultants, or auditors. 

The course seeks to: 
1)	Provide an in-depth understanding of key business processes of an organization, and how
         the data captured during the business process flow through to management and financial
         accounting.
2)	Train students to model key business process activities and identify risk and control
          issues related to a business process
3)	Provide comprehensive knowledge about AIS packages and enterprise resource planning
         (ERP) packages and explain how AIS/ERP packages are implemented.
4)	Provide students with an overview of some key modules of an ERP and teach students the
         skills of using an industry standard package such as SAP. 

Students will study how AIS/ERP is deployed in common business transactions. They will learn about the information flow in fundamental accounting processes and the major risks and controls associated with these processes. Students will be taught on how data is captured, processed, stored and accessed for generating management information and business reports and documents.

Students will gain hands-on training on ERP usage via lab sessions on SAP ? an industry standard ERP package. With an understanding of the systems development process and knowledge of AIS deployment in accounting and business processes from pre-lab sessions, students will gain an appreciation of the underlying workings of a typical ERP/AIS. This learning and experience will equip them with knowledge for more effective sourcing, selection, implementation and deployment of AIS/ERP packages in practice. In addition, students will also learn how they can make use of Excel for more effective reporting from the data generated through AIS/ERP packages.

AA306 is designed to provide students with a good understanding and appreciation of the operating and financial risks that firms face, and with a strong conceptual and technical knowledge in the measurement, reporting and analysis of these risks.

To provide focus to this course, emphasis is placed on two major areas:
(a)	Firms' investment strategy as part of its risk management policy, and the resultant
         consolidated financial statements;
(b)	Firms' use of financial instruments (including derivatives) which creates or reduces risks,
         and the impact of these financial instruments on the firms? financial position and
         performances.

During the discussion, this course will draw upon students? knowledge acquired in the earlier courses, particularly, AA201 Accounting Measurement and Disclosure, and AA205 Corporate Control and Risk Management.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.
