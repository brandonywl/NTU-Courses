Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Market intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting both internal and external sources of marketing information so as to enable the company to better understand the market environment in which it competes, thus equipping managers with the timely knowledge to make well-informed marketing decisions in a dynamic environment. Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the center of firms' decision making. This course helps students to understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. . It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing.  In addition, a strong relational approach is used in oppose to a transactional view of marketing.  Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions. Due to the limitation of the course duration, it is impossible to provide a how-to for managing all these relationships. Instead the course looks closer into the topic of customer relationship management and provides students with the tools and techniques to effectively use CRM.

The primary theme of the course is that service organizations require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy, both in its development and execution. A second theme of the course focuses on the role of service in manufacturing businesses. 

This course will suggest ways that firms in the manufactured goods sector might use 'service' as a primary source of competitive advantage. The design and delivery of services depends on the close coordination between marketing, operations management, information technology and human resources. As a result, an effective strategy to market services must be interdisciplinary in nature.
	
The seminars adopt an active-learning approach so that the student can discover, develop and transform knowledge which he/she can retain for further processing and reconstructionin the future. Activities consist of interactive lectures, discussions and presentations and out-of-classroom group projects. The primary aim of these activities is to help the student better understand the concepts, theories and tools learnt and relate themto the real world.
