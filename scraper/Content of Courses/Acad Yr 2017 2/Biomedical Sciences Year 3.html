This course largely focuses on Chinese Medicine Herbal Pharmacology. However, basic principles of Pharmacology will also be taught. The curriculum is planned accordingly to body systems. Using diseases from a specific system as a reference, the students will get to learn the pharmacological functions of the relevant drugs/herbs. As students are often in contact with the functions of herbs in TCM context, it will definitely be significant and beneficial for them to gain knowledge on today?s up-to-date pharmacological functions of the herbs, hence, widening their spectrum of knowledge. With these two sets of knowledge in hand, it will better prepare them for their clinical trainings.

In this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding and will become conversant in the applications of several critical spectroscopy techniques to Structural Biology. Mainly through X-ray diffraction of crystals (XRD), but also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Microscopy (EM), the atomic view of the biological world is continuously expanding. Although this solves many mysteries of molecular function, our understanding of structure and function often requires the use of other complementary techniques, especially those that rely on the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological molecules, i.e., spectroscopy. These spectroscopic methods provide essential insights that are not accessible by the main structural techniques (XRD, NMR or EM), in the structural analysis of biomolecules, their dynamics, protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, or the role of these biomolecules in a cellular environment. Overall, the aim is that you can use the acquired understanding of these techniques and apply it to a series of problems with examples from the literature, understanding at the same time their limitations, for their integration in your future projects. Current practice of Structural Biology is critically dependent on such integration. From a professional perspective, each of these techniques is a world in itself, and familiarity with its applications will also be useful in your future potential links with industry.

Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, consist of thousands of repeated G-rich sequences (TTAGGG in humans) decorated by DNA-binding proteins that form a telomeric capping structure called shelterin. Telomere maintenance is essential for genomic stability and cell viability. Telomere shortening correlates with cellular ageing, which limits the number of times a somatic cell can divide. In stem cells and 90% of human cancer, cell proliferation and immortalization requires activation of the telomerase enzyme. In this course, you will learn about the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase, protein and DNA interactions and cell cycle regulation of telomeric chromatin. Furthermore, the course covers telomere maintenance in cancer cells, accelerated ageing diseases, genome stability and DNA damage. The course contains introductory lectures as well as tutorials for in-depth discussions of current topics in the field.

In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

The aim of this workshop is to train students to apply proteomic strategy to biological and biomedical research. Students will use tissue and blood samples from large animal (pig and/or dog) models of ischemia heart disease to discover molecular biomarker and disease mechanism by analyzing the samples using mass spectromertry-based proteomic approach. Students won?t handle or do operation on the animal. The tissue and blood samples will be provided by a cardiac research laboratory. At the start of each day, a seminar will be presented by the faculty in-charge to allow students to understand the experiment and to learn the principles of various proteomic methods to be used. Then, the faculty in-charge and teaching assistants will teach the students how to prepare and analyze the proteomic samples, and how to apply bioinformatic tools for data analysis and interpretation. In this practical workshop, students will learn protein extraction and purification using mass spectrometry compatible buffers, shotgun proteomic sample preparation, HPLC protein separation and fractionation, hand-on mass spectrometry skills, mass spectrometry data interpretation, protein sequence database search for protein identification and post-translational modifications characterization. Students will also learn data mining to discover biomarker candidates and underlying molecular disease mechanism. At the end of every day, students will need to collate and discuss their data with the faculty in-charge. This will be conducted in the SMART classrooms. At the end of the course, students will need to submit a report and make presentations that will be graded by the faculty in-charge. As there is a limitation of the mass spectrometry instrument time for this course, the maximum class size will be constrained to 15 students.

Metabolites, including lipids, are mediators of biological processes and imbalance in metabolism is associated with diverse human pathology, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration as well as infection. Targeting metabolism is an attractive approach for treatment of some of these diseases. The field of metabolomics/ lipidomics have emerged, with the goal to provide the systems-level view of the complex metabolic networks which need to be kept in check to maintain a healthy state. This one-week course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in metabolomics and lipidomics. The course will focus on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisition and analyses using classical as well as novel lipidomics and metabolomics approaches. Here, you will perform extraction and analyses of lipids/ metabolites from cells treated with various drugs to investigate the impact of these drugs on cellular metabolism. You will process and analyse the metabolomics/ lipidomics datasets using open-source software(s). The knowledge will equip you for future works on metabolism and health, as well as advance graduate studies.
