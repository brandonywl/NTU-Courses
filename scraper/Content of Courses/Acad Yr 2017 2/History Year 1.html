Asia-Pacific in Global History: From 1800 examines major themes which inform the
study of world history following the start of the 19th century, particularly in two related
areas: trade and migration against the backdrop of colonialism, imperialism and nationbuilding.
The study of global history from an Asia-Pacific perspective looks at the history
of globalization which is not strictly defined in economic terms, but is informed by
themes, such as migration, environment, imperialism, biological exchange, etc. Even
though the year chosen is 1800, the foundation for changes which marked China and
Asia`s entry into the global economic system was laid in the middle of the 18th century.
In particular, one can point to the institution of the Canton system established by the
Chinese government to facilitate foreign trade, but which had various unforeseen
economic, social, and political repercussions. Through 13 weeks of lectures, students
will not only examine various themes such as migration, diaspora, colonialism,
nationalism, and trade which relate generally to global historical studies, but they will
also participate in current debates pertaining to the issues of global economic crises
and climate change.

The West in Global History takes students on a thematic journey through the history of
the world since the 1500s. Though many scholars differ in their selection of dates used
to mark major transformation in world history, this course chooses to use 1500 as a
date of convenience, since most scholars refer to 1492 as the turning point during which
the Old and New Worlds became connected. It also represents the point when the
'West' took its first steps toward economic, political, and cultural domination of the
world. Throughout the course of the semester, students will have to grapple with larger
historical issues such as Eurocentrism and other forms of bias, tradition versus
modernity, 'progress' versus 'decay', and continuity versus change. Students have to
determine whether the cause and effect paradigm is an adequate and comprehensive
method for studying historical issues. Subjects of discussion such as the ones
mentioned above are important in the field of history and other disciplines. These
scholarly considerations aside, the course will present students with opportunities to
engage with the past by presenting multiple perspectives on the motivation for and
impact of major transformations in human intellect, philosophy, social practices,
innovation, technology, and other areas.

In this class, students will become familiar with what some historians term 'The American Irony' - that American citizens have consistently acquired independence, freedom, and affluence by conquering, enslaving, and impoverishing other peoples. Students will explore the major events that shaped the development of the United States, from the colonial period through the War on Terror. In the process they will learn how the United States rose to a position of global hegemony, and question whether that situation is likely to endure. This class will particularly focus on issues of race, class, and gender, which carry relevance beyond the boundaries of the United States.

This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

This course examines the relationship between art, archaeology, and history in ancient Southeast Asia. This course spans the period from prehistory until 1600 which marks the approximate point when Southeast Asian polities and cultures began to change as a result of the forces of early colonialism. The course readings cover conventional themes in Southeast Asian ancient history. Topics include ?Indianization? (or Sanskritization as some scholars prefer to term it) in connection with Hindu and Buddhist concepts of kingship, processes of urbanization and state formation, networks of communications and trade, and their impact on the development of intellectual ideas, religious practices, art and architecture; and comparisons between the ideas of earlier Southeast Asian historians and new perspectives. This course will end with new data from the field by archaeologists and other scholars. There will also be discussions about whether the data support or refute established notions of the Southeast Asian past.

This course covers modern business history, drawing on case studies from the UK, Europe, America and Asia. This course takes a comparative approach to explore the development of modern businesses across Western and Asian societies. Business historians investigate both small and large enterprises and their management practices.
Importantly, they also consider the economic, political and social environments in which these businesses operate; this will also be our approach over the semester. The scope of this course is from the late 18th Century through until present times; we`ll trace the 10 development of modern business and business networks in Europe, UK, America and Asia. Case studies from historical and contemporary sources allows students to see the relevance of this field of study to our understanding of businesses in the present day.

In this class, students will explore the innovative field of marine environmental history. They will discover that, although oceans appear pristine and timeless, human societies have been modifying marine environments for centuries. In turn, these modified environments have shaped the course of human history. Students will examine how numerous societies around the world and through time have developed relationships with the sea, some of them sustainable and some of them not. Students will also learn about the complex systems of international cooperation that have emerged to facilitate the conservation of mobile marine species. Finally, students will learn how perceptions of oceans and ocean creatures have changed in response to cultural and scientific developments.

As obvious as it may be that history unfolds in time, we often lose sight that time itself has a history. This course explores three important elements of the history of time: its intellectual conception and cultural representation; its scientific and technological quantification, rationalization, and mastery; and its role in structuring societies and their activities. First, over the course of history, different cultures have conceived of time in a variety of ways (e.g. circular, cyclical, progressive) and on many different scales (e.g. cosmic, geologic, civilizational, industrial). In turn, these cultural conceptions of time have given rise to different ideas about the relationship of individual human lives to societies, and societies to history as a whole. Second, the effort to quantify time has given rise to a distinct science and technology of time-keeping, from the ancient sun-dial to today?s atomic clock. Third, the consciousness and quantification of time has made possible numerous social institutions and practices, ranging from the invention of interest on debt to the modern state to the institution of wage-labor. Through discussions of secondary texts and primary sources (including films, art works, and literary texts) this course will explore the history of time as a critical element of human experience from antiquity to present. Through the course, students will practice aesthetic analysis, formulating arguments, historical and cultural knowledge, and critical thinking.

This course is designed with the aim of enabling Arts and Humanities students to carefully research and analyze texts, reflect on them, and write disciplinarily appropriate essays.  The basic premise of the course is that effective writing in the Arts and Humanities is based on excellent, informed, and interdisciplinary analysis of original texts.  Students will be exposed to a variety of primary texts from their own discipline, as well as those of other disciplines in the Arts and Humanities, and taught how to approach and analyze them.  They will furthermore be taught how to incorporate and use arguments from secondary sources, how to develop strong research questions, and how to research and put together a strong research paper. Throughout, the course emphasizes a consideration of the how other disciplines contribute to research in their own discipline.
