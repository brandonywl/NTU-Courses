From the invention of the ploughshare to the rise of the Internet, technological advancement makes an impact on economic organisation, social relations, and cultural life. In developing this central theme, this course begins with an understanding of the rise of science as a social institution and as a predominant form of rationality. In addition to understanding basic shifts in the experience of time and space brought about by scientific and technological advances, the course considers specific changes in the way that people live, learn, work and play. The human and social consequences  benefits and costs  of the impact of such advances are also examined.

In its widest sense, culture refers to the sum total of ways of life that are shared by members of a society, providing a sense of social order and yet changing through time. In addition to the concept of material culture, this course focuses on intangible aspects of culture such as values, norms, ideas, beliefs and symbols, which govern the conduct of social life. Culture is transmitted by the institutions and processes of  socialization and is drawn into the social construction of personal and collective identities. The course also discusses changing conceptions of selfhood in modern society and issues related to ethnocentrism, cultural relativism, subculture, global culture, popular culture, and multiculturalism.

This course is designed with the aim of enabling Arts and Humanities students to carefully research and analyze texts, reflect on them, and write disciplinarily appropriate essays.  The basic premise of the course is that effective writing in the Arts and Humanities is based on excellent, informed, and interdisciplinary analysis of original texts.  Students will be exposed to a variety of primary texts from their own discipline, as well as those of other disciplines in the Arts and Humanities, and taught how to approach and analyze them.  They will furthermore be taught how to incorporate and use arguments from secondary sources, how to develop strong research questions, and how to research and put together a strong research paper. Throughout, the course emphasizes a consideration of the how other disciplines contribute to research in their own discipline.

This course is an introduction to selected problems of enduring philosophical importance. We begin by considering whether it can be rational to believe in the existence of God. This discussion is followed by a unit on the possibility, foundations, and limits of human knowledge. The next unit concerns issues in the philosophy of mind. We ask whether or not states of mind -e.g., conscious thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.- are purely physical states of the brain/body, and nothing more. We also discuss what it means for a person to have an 'identity'.Another unit explores competing perspectives on whether or not human beings have free will. Finally, we study a sampling of topics in moral philosophy, such as skepticism about morality, proposed standards of morally right conduct, and the nature of a just society. Students will learn a variety of concepts developed to clarify these matters. They will also be exposed to diverse philosophical perspectives, including both Western and non-Western approaches. In addition, students will be challenged to articulate wellreasoned answers to the main questions of the course.

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of modern logic, as well as applications of logic to classic philosophical problems and paradoxes. Many age-old philosophical problems are deceptively simple but are in fact quite complicated, and we can easily get confused. The first step towards rational and independent thinking is to clear away such confusions. Symbolic logic is a powerful set of techniques that are used by modern philosophers to think clearly about these
problems. The core of the class will consist of a sequence where students are introduced first to modern propositional logic, and then to predicate (first order) logic, using a natural deduction style proof system. Along the way, we will discuss some classic paradoxes such as the liar paradox,
Zeno?s paradox, and Russell?s paradox, as well as applications of logic to philosophical problems such as the ontological argument for the existence of God. Students will acquire concepts and techniques for thinking clearly and independently about these problems, and will then be able to apply
them to a wide range of problems, not just in philosophy.

This course examines ethical issues raised by ecological problems and environment-related concerns in today?s world, with a focus on rethinking the relationship between human beings and nature. The course will introduce philosophical theories and religious reflections about nature, from different perspectives, including non-Western as well as Western. It will investigate various inter-related questions ranging from the ethical to the metaphysical?for instance ?Do we have an obligation to natural objects??; ?If there should be an environmental ethics, what kind of ethics should it be??; etc. Through this course students will learn various concepts and theories on the subject; they will develop an ability to carry out philosophical inquiry and to independently think through a variety of moral issues. Students will have opportunities to develop and express their own views on these issues. They will also have opportunities to
rethink, revise, or reinforce their views.

What is the right thing to do? What is the fundamental nature of the universe? Are there limits to knowledge? These questions, which we continue to ask today, were also pondered and debated by philosophers over two thousand years ago, and in trying to answer them, they developed sophisticated systems of thought. This course aims to teach students the
views of the highly influential philosophers of ancient Greece, Rome, and other regions of the ancient world. The main philosophers covered will be Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and some of the Pre-Socratics. The course is structured around several topics, including ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.

This course introduces the canonical thinkers (Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Hume) in philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course challenges students to think about epistemological and metaphysical questions through these historical thinkers. Key questions include, 'What is the self?' 'What the source of knowledge?' 'Can we know the world as it is?' etc. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop high level critical thinking and writing skills by examining these historical texts and be challenged to think about the richness of philosophical issues that resulted from the new modern science.

The first half of the module examines the following question: What are race and gender? We begin by examining ?commonsense? (i.e., non-academic) concepts of race and gender that have been influential both historically and into the present day.  The shortcomings of the commonsense views of race and gender then provide a segue into an examination of attempts by scholars from a variety of disciplines to provide more adequate definitions of race and gender.  One major category of proposals state that race and gender are socially constructed categories.  Another major category of proposals says that concepts of race and gender can be grounded in biology, albeit in a different way that the ?commonsense? view claims.  Strengths and weaknesses of each of these proposals are examined.

The second half of the module builds on the first half by examining the social, political, and ethical dimensions of race and gender.  One overarching topic concerns the relationship between race/gender and inequality, as well as arguments for and against proposals such as affirmative action that are intended to remedy racial/gender inequalities.  Another major topic is the role that race and gender plays in shaping our social and political institutions, with specific sub-topics including race/gender and political representation as well as the role of race and gender in the criminal justice system.  A third topic is the psychology of race and gender, with particular attention to the ways in which stereotypes can (often unconsciously) shape our interactions and expectations.  The final topic is intersectionality, a theoretical framework for examining the ways in which race, gender, and other social categories interact to shape individual experiences.
