This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world?s population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

This course is an overview of some key issues in first language acquisition. It charts children's language development from birth right through the school years. The emphasis of the course is on evaluating crosslinguistic data against current theoretical models of language acquisition. Topics include phonological; morphological; grammatical; semantic and pragmatic development. The course will also evaluate the influence of the environment on the child's language development by examining studies on input and research on differences in socialisation patterns across languages. Students will have the opportunity to work with real language data from a variety of languages.

How do we speak the unspeakable? How do we talk about sex? Why do we talk about it the way we do? And why do we not talk about it when we don?t? Why is sex often taboo?... How do we construct our sexual subjectivities and how do we perform our sexual identities through language-in-use?... Do gays and lesbians have their own language(s)? What are the `labels? that have been applied to non-conformist sexual choices and non-heterosexual orientations throughout history? How have they changed? How and why do some of them get reclaimed and re appropriated by the very same people they were intended to offend and discriminate against? And how are some other offensive labels resisted and rejected? What are the main sociocultural and political significances of these linguistic interventions? What does language have to do with identity politics? What are the main achievements of the sexual political movements? And what are their shortcomings?... How do we verbalize our erotic desire?... How do we represent our sexuality online, and how do we construct discursively what/whom we want, or do not want?... Why are sexual jokes and innuendoes funny and/or provocative and socially disruptive even when not a single ?bad word? is used? 

These are among the questions we?ll be tackling throughout this course by examining a wide range of examples from around the world. We will critically reflect on insights and concepts from sociolinguistics, sociology, anthropology, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, literary criticism, media studies and related social sciences and humanities in order to develop an integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological toolbox which we will apply when analyzing the linguistic and discursive aspects of human sexuality. 

The course will provide ample opportunities for students to get hands-on experience by analyzing and discussing real-life language data. Students will be expected to do all the assigned readings on time, submit their reading notes and discussion questions the night before the class, and actively participate in our in-class discussions. 

Parental advisory: occasional explicit content! We will occasionally deal with ?strong language? throughout this course. The course is not suitable for those who may find such content objectionable. There will be no pornography in this course.

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

It aims to familiarise students with key concepts and common methods used in the construction of language corpora, as well as tools that have been developed for searching and using major corpora such as the British National Corpus. Students will be given hands-on experience in pre-editing, annotating, and searching corpora. Criteria and methods used for evaluating corpora and analytical tools will also be discussed. 
This course introduces basic corpus skills for linguists:
	Marking up extra information
	Selecting text
	The range of existing corpora
	How to build your own corpus
	Using corpora to test linguistic hypotheses
	Using corpora to train language tools

In this course we will examine how language is represented and learnt in the brain.  Cutting-edge findings from state of the art techniques using functional neuroimaging and lesion studies will be reviewed to enable students to understand the workings of the human brain in relation to language use. Specific aspects of language processing such as meaning representation, speech perception and learning, learning disabilities as well as the bilingual brain will be introduced. Basic neuroanatomy will also be covered to enable students to pursue further studies. This course introduces functional neuroimaging at an advanced level.

In this unit we focus on how we understand what someone is trying to communicate to us when they say or write something to us, especially how the particular words and structures are used for the purpose of getting us to understand just what the speaker intends. Given that the meaning of a word or structure depends on how it is used, we will look at the physical and cultural contexts within which communication occurs and develop an understanding of the role they play in the communication of meaning.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

Using materials from Mainland and Island Southeast Asia, the course will have two main themes:
 
Language-external: (a) The region?s array of languages examined historically and sociolinguistically. (b) The use of linguistic data in uncovering the region?s social and cultural history. (c) Language-change and language-loss in the face of present-day political pressures. (d) Language-engineering in the region?s nation-states. 

Language-internal: (a) Critical discussion of the various theoretical approaches to language-and-culture issues, both old and new, especially as presented in the literature of linguistic anthropology. (b) Discussion of the extent to which the organisation (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) of languages relates to their cultural and social contexts in which they are spoken.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

This proposed 48-hour Arabic Language Level 3 course is a continuation of the previous two Arabic courses offered by CML.  The course consolidates and extends the skills acquired on Arabic Language Levels 1 and 2 (ie, LA9001 and LA9002 respectively).  In this course, the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LA9002 are strengthened and expanded, enabling students to express themselves better in their written and oral expressions using the past, present and future tenses.  The course will enable learners to use Modern Standard Arabic in various real life situations and further enhance their ability in the four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The course teaches students to express themselves effectively in everyday communicative interactions beyond basic survival requirements.  It enables students to use a range of complex phrases and sentence structures as well as build on their vocabulary and idiomatic expressions.  It also further develops students? ability in reading and writing in the Arabic writing system so that they can successfully read and write.  Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex audio and written texts.

This 36-hour course aims to improve the fluency of the students in the French language and their knowledge of the French culture and civilization. Upon its completion, students will be able to express themselves orally and in writing in a more detailed manner about daily life topics and current affairs. They will also improve their reading and listening comprehension skills through more challenging materials, such as adapted journalistic texts on current affairs. Through books, videos, films, articles and class debates, it is hoped that they will gain further insight into French life and culture. During this course, students are expected to use little or no English as the course is taught solely in French. This course will also prepare the students for the higher levels of the international French exams DELF (Dipltme ilimentaire de langue frangaise).

This 48-hour German course is a continuation of the previous three courses offered by CML. In this course the fourth case (Genitive) is introduced and the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LG9003 are strengthened and expanded, enabling extensive written and oral expression in past, present and future tenses. Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex texts (reading and listening), which will enable a more complex and diverse understanding and use of the language in a variety of daily situations and discussions. 

Although the course develops all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) a special emphasis is placed on the active language production, especially the oral aspect. Audio-visual materials are used extensively and German is used almost exclusively as the language of instruction in the classroom.  

This course is equivalent to Level A2.2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and it prepares students to sit for the official external examination Start Deutsch 2 (SD2). The examination is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the German Language, issued and recognized by the German government and conducted at the Goethe Institut Singapur.

This course is a progression from the Level 2 course. In this course, students are introduced to a more advanced level of sentence construction and patterns.  These are taught through the exploration of interesting and current topics of interest, which provide a stimulus to conversation.  Learners' language competency will be enhanced through drills and practices, using a guided imitation method followed by situational applications to enable immediate practical usage.  Through the introduction of formal and informal expressions, students will have a deeper understanding of the more complex Japanese social practices where the mode of speech is determined by corresponding variations in human relationships and behaviour.  Students are exposed to more sophisticated dialogues recorded for listening practice with question drills to familiarize them to native-spoken Japanese.  An addition of approximately 330 words, 30 sentence patterns and 60 kanji characters will be covered in the syllabus.

This Spanish course is a continuation of the previous two levels, where more verb tenses in the past (present perfect and simple past) and future (simple future) are introduced, along with extensive vocabulary, grammar and expressions. This course focuses mainly on communication, where audio-visual materials play a very important role and Spanish is the main language of instruction in the classroom. 

Throughout the course, students will learn to use more complex grammar and structures to express past, present and future actions, personal experiences and opinions on everyday issues. Through audio-visual and written materials, students will be exposed to Hispanic culture.
