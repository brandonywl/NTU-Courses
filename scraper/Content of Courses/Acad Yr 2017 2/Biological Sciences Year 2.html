Six biological topics have been selected covering enzyme to ecology. A short description of each equation and the learning outcomes from each topic has been given below. Every topic will be introduced with investigative approach to the point where mathematics comes in to solve the biological problem. The mathematical principles (equations) are rather simple and well within A-level category. On the other hand, these equations have contributed to the fundamental questions of twentieth century biology. Using each of these equations, the students have to solve numerical problems related to cross-talk between biology and mathematics. This is not meant to teach mathematics as in a typical mathematics course because it is a biology course with emphasis on the importance of mathematics.

In this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding and will become conversant in the applications of several critical spectroscopy techniques to Structural Biology. Mainly through X-ray diffraction of crystals (XRD), but also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Microscopy (EM), the atomic view of the biological world is continuously expanding. Although this solves many mysteries of molecular function, our understanding of structure and function often requires the use of other complementary techniques, especially those that rely on the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological molecules, i.e., spectroscopy. These spectroscopic methods provide essential insights that are not accessible by the main structural techniques (XRD, NMR or EM), in the structural analysis of biomolecules, their dynamics, protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, or the role of these biomolecules in a cellular environment. Overall, the aim is that you can use the acquired understanding of these techniques and apply it to a series of problems with examples from the literature, understanding at the same time their limitations, for their integration in your future projects. Current practice of Structural Biology is critically dependent on such integration. From a professional perspective, each of these techniques is a world in itself, and familiarity with its applications will also be useful in your future potential links with industry.

Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, consist of thousands of repeated G-rich sequences (TTAGGG in humans) decorated by DNA-binding proteins that form a telomeric capping structure called shelterin. Telomere maintenance is essential for genomic stability and cell viability. Telomere shortening correlates with cellular ageing, which limits the number of times a somatic cell can divide. In stem cells and 90% of human cancer, cell proliferation and immortalization requires activation of the telomerase enzyme. In this course, you will learn about the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase, protein and DNA interactions and cell cycle regulation of telomeric chromatin. Furthermore, the course covers telomere maintenance in cancer cells, accelerated ageing diseases, genome stability and DNA damage. The course contains introductory lectures as well as tutorials for in-depth discussions of current topics in the field.

In this module, students will be tasked to design and perform experiments to identify phenotypes of different strains of knock-out mice that are immune compromised. Students will need to have a good background in immunology (hence the pre-requisite of BS2007) for this module. At the start of each day, a seminar will be presented by the faculty in-charge to allow students to understand the rationale of the 5-day mini-project and to recap on the principles of different methods to be used. Students will then design the experiments and discuss with the faculty in-charge and teaching assistants before performing the experiments. For the experiments, students will need to isolate cells from lymphoid organs of these mice. Students will need to prepare blood smears of these cells and examine them under the microscope. Students will also need to perform immunostaining of these cells and determine their surface markers by flow cytometry analyses. In addition, students will perform ELISA assays to assess the antibody response in these mice that have been injected with antigens. PCR genotyping will also be performed on these mice. At the end of every day, students will need to collate and discuss their data with the faculty in-charge. This will be conducted in the SMART classrooms. At the end of the course, students will need to submit a report and make presentations that will be graded by the faculty in-charge.

In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

Metabolites, including lipids, are mediators of biological processes and imbalance in metabolism is associated with diverse human pathology, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration as well as infection. Targeting metabolism is an attractive approach for treatment of some of these diseases. The field of metabolomics/ lipidomics have emerged, with the goal to provide the systems-level view of the complex metabolic networks which need to be kept in check to maintain a healthy state. This one-week course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in metabolomics and lipidomics. The course will focus on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisition and analyses using classical as well as novel lipidomics and metabolomics approaches. Here, you will perform extraction and analyses of lipids/ metabolites from cells treated with various drugs to investigate the impact of these drugs on cellular metabolism. You will process and analyse the metabolomics/ lipidomics datasets using open-source software(s). The knowledge will equip you for future works on metabolism and health, as well as advance graduate studies.

The aim of the course is to enhance the abilities of science students in recognising and employing the conventions used by scientists in their field for communication in both academic and public settings. In this course, the emphasis is on micro skills in scientific communication such as searching academic databases, critically reading scientific texts, citing from sources, composing scientific arguments and making effective presentations to a non-specialist audience. As this is a foundation course, it will ensure that science students are ready to engage with the more challenging skills of the second and more advanced scientific communication course that follows.
