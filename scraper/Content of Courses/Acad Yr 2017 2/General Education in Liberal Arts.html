This course will focus on the developments in the visual arts in China from the end of the imperial period during the late nineteenth century to the present day and will relate them to broader changes in Chinese culture. It will look at the ways in which visual material forms and contexts art, as well as the social roles of its makers and audiences. The course will study how these change over this period and will also focus on a broad range of visual materials from painting in the `traditional? and `western? formats, through to performance and installation art; to graphics, photography and craft work. As an upper-level seminar class, this course aims to engage students in the process of research and interpretation both textual and visual, through lectures, discussions, presentations and the execution of a research paper.

The act of eating encompasses many aspects of biology. From the stimulation of sensory organs during tasting, digestion, to nutritional absorption and homeostasis that follow, each stage of these biological processes has significant influence on the consumers? perception of ?eating experience?. Furthermore, conditions such as food allergy have specific physiological consequences that warrant attention and consideration. At the other end of the spectrum, both the biology of living things serving as food material and the methods of food preparation has impacts on the tastes of food. These factors will be considered holistically through projects addressing various themes.

Practical Ethics' is a course for students who want to make sense of the idea of right and wrong in a commonsense and practical way that relates to the world we live in (especially in the business context) that is informed by a firm introduction to the main ideas of some of the most important ethical theories.

The first half of the course is an introduction to the elements of ethical reasoning and the main branches of ethical theories and some of their chief modern proponents.  This lays the groundwork for the second half: which will critically apply these concepts thus examined to a consideration of the role of law and ethics in some of the paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  These may include:  corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and child labour (people), international business and public corruption, and environmental sustainability (planet). The seminars will be structured around problems (hypothethical and real) and possibly a few video clips for discussions which are intended to be interesting and engaging whilst providing the context for a serious inquiry into the issues.  Leaders of all kinds, especially those of businesses, are expected in today?s world to be sensitive to ethical dimensions of our reality. This course aims to provide the foundation for such ethical understanding and thinking.

The assessment will be based entirely on coursework: participation, presentation, and a written assignment. There are no prerequisites for the course.

NOTE: "Prospective students should take note that this is a participation intensive course intended for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. Students not prepared to undertake this are not expected to do well.?

Tourism occupies an important place in society and this course deals with the many roles it plays and purposes served. Following accounts of its current and past stages of development, the psychological and social significance of tourism are explored. Its various meanings are discussed, including within the context of religion and food. Socio-cultural impacts of tourist activity are assessed and the use of culture as a tourist attraction is reviewed which includes consideration of the relationship between history, heritage and tourism. Tourism's interactions with the environment and its contribution to sustainable development are another topic, as is the politics of tourism which extends to matters of terrorism and its effects. 

Finally, the attributes of tourism as a business and questions of destination marketing are addressed before debate about future scenarios. While illustrations are drawn from Singapore and the region, discussions will range more widely and encompass cases from around the world.

With the disposable income and life expectancy increasing, many consumers are willing to spend considerable amount of income on seeking and keeping health and beauty. Healthy lifestyle has become a global trend with many health conscious followers. With the growing ageing population around the world, high quality healthcare services that provides patients a pleasant experience are in great demand. This course will provide an overview of conducting marketing in three sectors of the growing health industry: 1. Consumer health and beauty products/services (e.g. healthy foods, gym membership, sports apparel, slimming treatment services); 2. Healthcare services (e.g. services in hospitals, clinics, senior-living communities, pharmacies); and 3. Health and wellness tourism (e.g. travel for medical exam, medical spa, spiritual experiences, mind-body connection). The business environment of these sectors will be reviewed. Current trends, opportunities and challenges will be highlighted to help students learn and practice how to develop marketing strategy in these sectors. On the other hand, students as consumers will gain insights into their own pursuit of health, beauty, and wellness with a deeper understanding of the business landscapes of these sectors. Fundamental marketing concepts, principles, and frameworks will be reviewed to ensure that non-business students are also equipped with necessary marketing knowledge to work on the course assignments and projects.

We live in a global world, where a premium is placed on the ability to navigate and adapt to differences. Cultural intelligence, CQ is the capability to function effectively across national, ethnic and organizational, organizational cultures (Ang & Van Dyne). IQ and EQ are no longer enough, CQ is becoming a critical predictor for success in the borderless world of the 21st century. The good news is that CQ can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. This course will focus on providing students a conceptual framework for CQ, as well as a set of tools to navigate and explore the world.

At the end of the course, students can expect the following outcomes:-
(1)	A greater understanding of their own motivation, culture, values, and personality, as well
         as their CQ strengths and weaknesses (CQ Motivation & Strategy) 

(2)	Knowledge and experience of how cultures differ in values and behaviours, and how to
         capitalize on similarities, and leverage on the differences (CQ Knowledge);
 
(3)	Enhanced awareness and efficacy of your own communication style in cross cultural
         contexts (CQ Behaviour)

Teaching Method: 

Highly experiential and focused on learning from own self-reflection, class activities and group work, this course focuses on bringing conceptual knowledge to life.

1. What is the course trying to achieve? (Purpose)
Using theories and evidence based on psychology, behavioral economics and decision
neuroscience, this course aims to help you understand the decision making processes and
especially the typical errors and biases that influence choice behavior. Armed with this
knowledge , you will be able to (i) understand and improve your own decision making abilities, (ii) understand the decision making of other stakeholders such as consumers, policy makers, patients, managers and (ii) improve and design services, strategies and policies that influence your target audiences.
2. Why should someone take this course e.g. future career, future course, etc.? (Value)
The first reason is to understand the decision making processes of various stakeholders ?
consumers, entrepreneurs, managers, public, accountants. The second reason is to help you
improve your own decision making abilities ? one of the most critical skills for the future
managers, professionals, doctors, and accountants. Finally, different companies and organizations have established behavioral units that employ the principles taught in this course to improve their services and functions. Both companies as well as governmental organizations have been actively adopting the principles of Behavioral Decision Science. This shows the importance of understanding human behavior in the design of services, strategies and policies.

This course mainly focuses on films produced by Chinese communities living in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. The geographical demarcation also marks the different cultural and social contexts in which the films are made and marketed at. The films selected for cultural appreciation in the course not only represent the major cultural developments and trends they have contributed to world cinema but also the intellectual meanings and emotional impact they play among Chinese and non-Chinese audiences. By exploring different varieties of Chinese cinemas, students will gain an in-depth knowledge of the societies in which they originate from and the inner and cross-cultural dialogues that preside within.
[This course is conducted in English].

This course examines the ways in which madness is interpreted in selected literature and films from late 19th century onwards. Is madness a matter of perspective, biological disorder, subversion or metaphor? We examine four possible categories: the mentally ill with self-awareness of their debilitating condition; alienated individuals deviating from societal norms; mentally unsound individuals labeled insane by experts; and individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder in enacting transgressive acts. Using close reading of literary and visual narratives, this course will discuss madness in the contexts of self-awareness, creativity, alienation and isolation, language as construct, women and representation, the institution, sexual dysfunction and violence.

This course examines the ways in which utopian thought and absolute control can be manifested in societies. While most would reject any society that forces them to give up free will though pain and torture, how would one react to one that promises you a life of pleasure, peace and absence from fear in exchange for absolute compliance? Using close reading of literary, graphic novel, musical and visual narratives, this course will discuss the construction of control and power through the varied visions of utopias and dystopias in the contexts of individuality, culture, family, law, justice, the self in the context of a community, role of women, impact of science, freedom of thought and expression.

This course provides an overview of the complex relationship between two universal human activities that not only satisfy our basic needs (to survive and to communicate), but have a deep symbolic, often ritualised, cultural component as well. By drawing on linguistics, linguistic anthropology, sociology, cognitive science and media studies, the course introduces the interdisciplinary field of linguistics by examining the interplay between language and food-related practices (food classification and naming, food preparation, eating and drinking) in various historical and socio-cultural contexts around the world. It tells a story of food names and cross-cultural contact and borrowing, of what metaphors are and how they are formed, of the `grammar? of various culinary traditions, of social stratification and symbolic capital as they are related to `food talk?, of regional linguistic variation, and of advertising. The course addresses an engaging topic in order to familiarise students with a number of important social scientific concepts, and to develop their critical thinking skills.

This course takes into account evolutionary, ethnic, geographical and historical factors that have led to the development and spread of the roughly 7000 languages that are currently spoken in the world. Students will develop an appreciation of key issues in linguistic classification and description, why there are different accents, the relationship between dialect and language, and the types of evidence used by linguists to establish genetic affiliations.

1.	In this elective we will look at who language conveys meaning, using examples taken from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. The course considers meaning from the smallest levels of words and morphemes, up through sentences to the stories as a whole. Finally, we consider how Sherlock Holmes stories have entered into popular culture, both through translation into other languages and into other media, such as films and TV.
2.	In the first half of the course, we will look at how words convey meanings and how they can be combined to express richer meaning (semantics). We will show that meaning does not only come from the words themselves, but also from our own understanding of them, and that words can convey much more than simple truth-conditional meanings (pragmatics).
3.	In the second half of the course, we will show how the stories (and other works adapted from them) convey meaning to the reader, as well as how the meaning becomes part of our cultural heritage.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

Are you OK? We often ask each other this question. We are often concerned about the psychological well-being of our family members, friends, and, most importantly ourselves. In this course, we will discuss issues concerning psychological well-being and mental health in Singapore: the early signs of not being "OK", when you might need professional help, and where you might find the appropriate help. The course will be taught by a seasoned mental health practitioner in Singapore, in collaboration with our in-house faculty members.

In today's fast-paced and competitive work environment, a student is often lost as to how and where to find jobs and how to manage one's career. This course will provide an introduction to the contemporary human resource management functions: employment, employee relations, training and development, performance systems, compensation, benefits, and human resource information systems. It is not the objective of this course to train students to be HRM managers, but to provide basic information for students to plan and manage their own careers.
