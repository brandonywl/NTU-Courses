The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

In today's global and digital business environment, the enterprise analytics challenge is growing, because companies are dealing with steadily escalating volumes of data. The access to such analytics capability is often hampered by the problem of data silos, in which data for different departments, divisions, product lines, etc., is stored and managed differently. Enterprise Systems are major investments that seek to minimize such problems. They form the backbone of organizations' business processes and hold the key to unlock strategic data assets within the firms. This course is designed to provide an overview to enterprise systems, primarily covering the range of embedded 'best practice' business processes (e.g., order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, production planning and execution, accounting) and the related data that needs to be carefully managed. Our objective is to develop an application consulting perspective among the students that is sensitive to managerial issues in assessing, configuring, and managing the radical implementation of enterprise systems and using the insights from such enterprise systems. A specific emphasis is on the extraction, manipulation, and exploitation of such enterprise data to optimize processes, decisions, and business performance. This is particularly pertinent as many organizations do not have just one enterprise system but also other systems where the other databases are kept (e.g., spreadsheets, vendor databases, legacy systems, web data).

The course places a dual emphasis on both conceptual learning (through student-led presentations and business case discussions on enterprise analytics) and practical exposures to enterprise systems (through heavy hands-on lab on SAP and data analytics tools). Students should acquire a sound entry-level grounding in the ERP software, for them to work towards an industry accredited SAP TERP10 certification if they are interested.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard the jargon phrases, such as `globalization',`multinational corporation', and `cross-border transactions', many of which are now cliches. Despite this, doing business internationally is not easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, is international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment. 
This course aims to provide students with a clear foundation in the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders.

The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.
