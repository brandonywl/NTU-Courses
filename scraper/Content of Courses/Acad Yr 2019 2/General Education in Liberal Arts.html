This course is an experiential exploration of the ways in which everyday lives in a city like Singapore are structured by power, possibility and psychogeography. Students will interrogate the ways public and private spaces such as housing estates, public and corporate institutions, school campuses, city streets and shopping malls structure the individual imagination. They will then explore how these spaces become infused with a myriad of personal stories, memories, fictions, poetics and possibilities.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

Practical Ethics' is a course for students who want to make sense of the idea of right and wrong in a commonsense and practical way that relates to the world we live in (especially in the business context) that is informed by a firm introduction to the main ideas of some of the most important ethical theories.

The first half of the course is an introduction to the elements of ethical reasoning and the main branches of ethical theories and some of their chief modern proponents.  This lays the groundwork for the second half: which will critically apply these concepts thus examined to a consideration of the role of law and ethics in some of the paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  These may include:  corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and child labour (people), international business and public corruption, and environmental sustainability (planet). The seminars will be structured around problems (hypothethical and real) and possibly a few video clips for discussions which are intended to be interesting and engaging whilst providing the context for a serious inquiry into the issues.  Leaders of all kinds, especially those of businesses, are expected in today?s world to be sensitive to ethical dimensions of our reality. This course aims to provide the foundation for such ethical understanding and thinking.

The assessment will be based entirely on coursework: participation, presentation, and a written assignment. There are no prerequisites for the course.

NOTE: "Prospective students should take note that this is a participation intensive course intended for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. Students not prepared to undertake this are not expected to do well.?

The health, beauty, and wellness industry is predicted to have a strong growth in the coming years. With the disposable income and life expectancy increasing, many consumers are willing to spend considerable amount of income on seeking and keeping health and beauty. Healthy lifestyle has become a global trend with many health conscious followers. With the growing ageing population around the world, high quality healthcare services that provides patients a pleasant experience are in great demand. This course will provide an overview of conducting marketing in three sectors of the growing health industry: 1. Consumer health and beauty products/services (e.g. healthy foods, gym membership, sports apparel, slimming treatment services); 2. Healthcare services (e.g. services in hospitals, clinics, senior-living communities, pharmacies); and 3. Health and wellness tourism (e.g. travel for medical exam, medical spa, spiritual experiences, mind-body connection). The business environment of these sectors will be reviewed. Current trends, opportunities and challenges will be highlighted to help students learn and practice how to develop marketing strategy in these sectors. On the other hand, students as consumers will gain insights into their own pursuit of health, beauty, and wellness with a deeper understanding of the business landscapes of these sectors. Fundamental marketing concepts, principles, and frameworks will be reviewed to ensure that non-business students are also equipped with necessary marketing knowledge to work on the course assignments and projects.

We live in a global world, where a premium is placed on the ability to navigate and adapt to differences. Cultural intelligence, CQ is the capability to function effectively across national, ethnic and organizational, organizational cultures (Ang & Van Dyne). IQ and EQ are no longer enough, CQ is becoming a critical predictor for success in the borderless world of the 21st century. The good news is that CQ can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. This course will focus on providing students a conceptual framework for CQ, as well as a set of tools to navigate and explore the world.

At the end of the course, students can expect the following outcomes:-
(1)	A greater understanding of their own motivation, culture, values, and personality, as well
         as their CQ strengths and weaknesses (CQ Motivation & Strategy) 

(2)	Knowledge and experience of how cultures differ in values and behaviours, and how to
         capitalize on similarities, and leverage on the differences (CQ Knowledge);
 
(3)	Enhanced awareness and efficacy of your own communication style in cross cultural
         contexts (CQ Behaviour)

Teaching Method: 

Highly experiential and focused on learning from own self-reflection, class activities and group work, this course focuses on bringing conceptual knowledge to life.

Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions.

Drawing from a wide range of historical, literary and cultural texts that make 'animal' a common subject matter, this course's major aim is to offer students from all academic backgrounds and levels a broad and general overview of Chinese history, culture and society through the selected texts about animals in China.  
The course will explore the constructions of Chinese culture and society via a range of discourses such as Chinese philosophy and aesthetics; semiotics and representations; adaptations; gender, cultural and political identities; food culture; conservation and tourism studies; environmental and medical histories; as well as animal welfare and environmental humanities. These multidisciplinary approaches will develop your appreciation and critical reflection of Chinese art and culture from various perspectives.
Through the changing relationships between humans and animals, the course also highlights transformations of social and cultural values in recent decades, as reflected in the growing awareness of animal welfare, and social movements against animal injustice in contemporary China. As a result, you will learn the significant roles of animals in our society, as well as the interconnectedness between human beings and animals.

This course examines the ways in which madness is interpreted in selected literature and films from late 19th century onwards. Is madness a matter of perspective, biological disorder, subversion or metaphor? We examine four possible categories: the mentally ill with self-awareness of their debilitating condition; alienated individuals deviating from societal norms; mentally unsound individuals labeled insane by experts; and individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder in enacting transgressive acts. Using close reading of literary and visual narratives, this course will discuss madness in the contexts of self-awareness, creativity, alienation and isolation, language as construct, women and representation, the institution, sexual dysfunction and violence.

Given that Introduction to Gender and Diversity is proposed as a module for a Minor programme,
it would take a broad, introductory approach to the critical  theory and its socio-political  and
historical contexts. The module will explore the intersectional constructions of gendered identity
according to a range of discourses that concern femininity, masculinity, transgendered identity, disability, ethnicity, class, nationality and virtual identities. It will consider the ways in which these discourses  underpin contemporary debates about diversity.   The  module encourages you to develop a broad  knowledge of the subjects studied and to hone your analytical  skills, with an appreciation of the conflicts and nuances inherent in discussions about diversity and gendered identities.  Furthermore, over the course of the module, you should develop articulacy and self-assurance in academic debate, both in class discussion and in written work.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

Are you OK? We often ask each other this question. We are often concerned about the psychological well-being of our family members, friends, and, most importantly ourselves. In this course, we will discuss issues concerning psychological well-being and mental health in Singapore: the early signs of not being "OK", when you might need professional help, and where you might find the appropriate help. The course will be taught by a seasoned mental health practitioner in Singapore, in collaboration with our in-house faculty members.

In today's fast-paced and competitive work environment, a student is often lost as to how and where to find jobs and how to manage one's career. This course will provide an introduction to the contemporary human resource management functions: employment, employee relations, training and development, performance systems, compensation, benefits, and human resource information systems. It is not the objective of this course to train students to be HRM managers, but to provide basic information for students to plan and manage their own careers.
