This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

This studio course provides a practical study of the aesthetics, techniques and processes of audio post production for narrative film. In this course you learn how to edit and clean production dialogue, record sound effects (on location and in studio), use sound effects libraries, create natural sound effects (Foley) and create Automated Dialogue Recording (ADR). You will employ these techniques to create a layered sound mix that augments the emotional drive of a film, firstly as a pre-dub or temporary mix, and then as a final form of broadcast quality for professional delivery. You will also develop your ability to collaborate with members of a post-production team such as the director, editor, composer and music supervisor. This course provides fundamental sound editing skills that you can apply to any media project at any level.

This is an entry-level course that focuses on creation of films that allow experimentation in various stages of filmmaking processes, including the development of various alternate forms of (non) narrative story structures. You will be exposed to a range of conceptual and production strategies in experimental film using key historical and contemporary examples and then put those ideas into practice through exercises and projects in order to develop your own experimental film practice. Experience and knowledge gained in this module will provide a basis for further more developed experimental film production, as well as complementing research into this field.

This is an introductory course that will introduce you to the fundamental concepts shared by all core programming languages. The core structure and foundations of common programming languages will be explored in a theoretical and practical manner as well as demonstrating that sometimes vastly different applications such as games, websites and installations are based on similar logical and structural principles. By the end of the course, you will be able to write basic games, and create interactive environments. This will allow you to create digital systems and artwork individually or collectively in future practice.

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

This course will introduce you to computer 3D modelling and animation. Emphasis is placed on learning techniques, principles and strategies to enable on-going independent learning of the specialist 3D software used. A wide variety of processes will be reviewed in order to provide an overall awareness of the complete 3D animation production process. Technical processes introduced include modelling, texturing, simple rigging, keyframe animation, lighting and rendering.

Once you have gained enough familiarity with essential processes, you will produce a short animation that demonstrates your culminated learning.

Most class sessions will contain demonstrations of a particular process by the instructor, reinforced with exercises and tasks for you to perform. 3D Production is comprised of many essential processes that once understood, offer a powerful digital toolset for creative expression and further refinement.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will expand beyond the foundations of game design to focus on game mechanics. You will explore how game mechanics provides a structure and purpose for a player's participation in a game. You will then apply mechanics theory and principles to create a game that is developed around a distinct game mechanic. The learning in this course contributes directly to further independent study in game design.

Visual report study:
Theoretical and practical analysis of printed media that allow visualizing stories effectively in accordance to a specific target audience. Visual reports will be examined throughout a wide range of case studies. 

Special-interest publication analysis:
By means of an investigation on special interest publications, its history and function, you will understand how to express the identity of particular groups through your own voice. 

The need for publishing and the choice of media:
You will analyze the stories to be published. You will consequently develop your own approach to communicate them. Parallel to the former, there will be a reflection on the choice of media selected for publishing. 

Editorial design as a communication strategy:
From idea generation to publishing, you will be able to comprehend and cohesively plan an editorial project. 

Assignments and exercises:
Project 1: Exercises that test ability to engage in an editorial design project. 

Project 2: Intermediary assignment that introduces theory and practice regarding designing for print or digital environments with multiples levels of information across one or more editions.

Project 3: Advanced final project that integrates all theory and practice-based learning acquired during the course. The main objective of this project is to understand the editorial design production process. It focuses on the analysis of an editorial project as a whole from researching, data-generation, writing and designing to publishing.

In this introductory course, you will explore the conceptual, three-dimensional and experiential solutions for built environments. By combining theory and practice-based research, you will receive an overview of spatial design strategies and practices. You will investigate the application of a variety of media to three dimensional spaces. This course further explores the spatial issues of scale, structure, form, materiality, light and kinaesthetic principles in spatial design projects such as visual merchandising, experience branding, place-making and way-finding.
