The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

This is an introductory course in finance for non-business and non-accounting students, which provides students with a broad understanding of the principles and practice of Business Finance/Financial Management.   The emphasis is on the major financial decisions made by companies and the valuation of investments made by them.  The course starts by examining the various forms of businesses and the importance of interest rates.  Time value of money, and the linkage between risk and return, lays the foundation for evaluating the price of bonds and stocks.  Students will learn and apply principles of capital budgeting (calculating the profitability of various projects and deciding which one to proceed) and capital structure (financing approved projects by issuing shares or bonds, or using retained earnings).  The decision to use extra cash to pay dividends or repurchase shares will be analysed and the course concludes with the use of derivatives to protect and enhance the value of firms.

Students intending to take this course should be numerate (good and comfortable with mathematical calculations and formulas) e.g. they should know well compound interest calculations, Sum of Geometric Progression (G.P.) calculation before attending this course.

This course is designed for students who have chosen to specialise in disciplines other than business. As students may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is rather useful wherever their career takes them. We will discuss the basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its practice and how this understanding could potentially enhance the students' future performance in their chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected of students and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, lead discussions and present your analysis and recommendations on selected organisations.

Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.

This course is concerned with the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication activities.  The course primarily takes the marketer's perspective, requiring you to consider and critically evaluate factors influencing both the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated marketing communication (IMC) programs.  In this course, we regard IMC as a system of thinking, processes and coordinated activities driven by the marketer's objectives. Adopting a global perspective, we draw illustrative examples and cases from different parts of the world and discuss issues faced by marketers in conducting IMC programs across countries. 

The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.

Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.  While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

To function in an organisation, technical skills by themselves are insufficient; they have to be supplemented by management training.  Success in an organisation depends as much on general management skills and understanding operational systems as on technical expertise.  Hence, students need a firm foundation in management skills.  This course is designed for non-business students and aims to equip them with the knowledge, skills and competence in various aspects of management, including: the role of management and managers; decision-making, planning and strategy; managing organisational architecture; managing individuals and groups; and controlling critical organisational processes.
