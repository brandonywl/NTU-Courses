This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

This studio course provides a practical study of the aesthetics, techniques and processes of audio post production for narrative film. In this course you learn how to edit and clean production dialogue, record sound effects (on location and in studio), use sound effects libraries, create natural sound effects (Foley) and create Automated Dialogue Recording (ADR). You will employ these techniques to create a layered sound mix that augments the emotional drive of a film, firstly as a pre-dub or temporary mix, and then as a final form of broadcast quality for professional delivery. You will also develop your ability to collaborate with members of a post-production team such as the director, editor, composer and music supervisor. This course provides fundamental sound editing skills that you can apply to any media project at any level.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.
