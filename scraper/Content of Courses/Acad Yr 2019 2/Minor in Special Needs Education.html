This course provides student teachers a basic understanding of the main concepts of special needs education and inclusion. It is important that those working with individuals with disabilities or special needs gain foundational knowledge and understanding of special needs education and inclusion, particularly in the Singapore context. This course seeks to introduce students to the historical trends and contemporary issues concerning individuals with special needs/disabilities at the local as well as international contexts.  Students will have the opportunity to learn how persons with different disabilities/special needs can be supported within school, home and community environments. Contemporary issues in special education and inclusive education that affect the knowledge, understanding and service provision for various disabilities/special needs in Singapore and elsewhere will be addressed. Students will also have the opportunity to clarify and affirm their values, beliefs, roles and responsibilities in serving the needs of persons with special needs.
