This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

This is an introductory course that will introduce you to the fundamental concepts shared by all core programming languages. The core structure and foundations of common programming languages will be explored in a theoretical and practical manner as well as demonstrating that sometimes vastly different applications such as games, websites and installations are based on similar logical and structural principles. By the end of the course, you will be able to write basic games, and create interactive environments. This will allow you to create digital systems and artwork individually or collectively in future practice.

This course focuses on connecting the worlds of objects, experiences and meanings through a conceptual framework. It introduces the student to the importance of juxtaposing new and contradictory design situations with the task of understanding and resolving them. Subjects are examined through a conceptual lens: studying different aspects of semantics, imagery, perception, behaviour, beliefs, culture as structural frameworks in the development of ideas. Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.

Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process:
The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.

Design as Discourse/ Critical Design:
You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

Conceptual Design projects:
You will apply conceptual and critical design methods to realize design projects based on various themes.

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

Typography Design II provides the opportunity to develop effective and innovative typographic practice, an indispensable foundation for other visual communication courses. You will examine the essential function that typography plays and develop the necessary skills and techniques to use typography in the support of effective visual communication.
Through lectures, in-class demonstrations, discussions, comprehensive projects and critiques, you will develop and apply principles of typography such as typographic identification, composition, layout, form, hierarchy, application to multi-page layout, and the enhancement of meaning and content.
Assignments are focused on applying and exploring the application of typography adhering to aesthetic and theoretical principles. The assignments allow you to focus on meaning, style and functionality as equal collaborators in effective typographic communication. Projects are intermediate to advanced in level and develop your existing skills in a systematic way throughout the semester. Essential components of this course include research, conceptual development, verbal articulation of visual solutions, production, and visual, verbal and written presentation. Typography Design II also includes the consideration of multiple languages and cultures.
