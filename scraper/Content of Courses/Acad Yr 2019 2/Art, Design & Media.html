Working from observation
In this course you will consistently work from observation in order to hone your eye and become more sensitive to the dimensional world around you. You will learn to perceive proportion both intuitively and also through measuring. You will explore concepts of composition, line work, shape design, value structure, and colour, in order to translate your ideas and perceptions into a finished drawing or sequence.

Investigating and experimenting with materials
You will be continually compelled to challenge yourself with new techniques and materials. From pen and ink, to charcoal to watercolour, this course will serve as an introduction to many new materials and processes

Finding personal aesthetic
You will continually work toward developing your pictorial goals. You will be asked to first define your specific aesthetic goals including composition, line work, lighting effects etc., and then chart a course for improving towards those goals

Integrating sketching into a creative workflow
In this class you will be encouraged to make free standing drawings that function as independent art pieces, and also to utilise drawing as a primary step in ideation.  By utilising observational as well as reference drawing, you will develop a process by which to create well informed and well observed drawings.

The course is conducted in a studio/classroom or at a site-specific place corresponding to the assignment. The instructor and students observe the progress of everyone's work, and contribute critique as it is being made. Learning is a collective experience in the classroom, and you will problem-solve on the canvas, benefitting from a cross-pollination of ideas and input from your peers. It is therefore very important that you attend all classes. 

The semester begins with representational painting using slow-drying, indirect oil painting techniques learning basic paint mixing, colour observation and composition. Gradually you will become more independent with your work. The semester ends with experimentation of modernist direct application of wet-in-wet acrylic paint. 

The course also offers opportunities to collaborate with local museum exhibitions as well as international students, artists and communities.

Course content includes:
1.	Introduction to materials: 
             primers and painting surfaces;
             properties of oil paint;
                      properties of water based acrylic paint.
2.	Colour mixing and seeing colour:
              Seeing and mixing cool tones;
              Seeing and mixing warm tones.
3.	Elements of Composition & Design with perceptual painting:
             Movement: Directional lines leading the eye;
             Creating space or flat colour;
             Balance, contrast, emphasis, Rhythm.
4.	Painting handling:
             Texture;
             Use of mediums;
             Working with unconventional tools.
5.	Portraiture:
             Proportions of the head;
             Seeing and mixing flesh tones.
6.	Night landscape:
             Simplifying form;
             Seeing and mixing night tones.
7.	Principals of Abstraction and working from references:
              Working from references;

The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.
Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

This course is an experiential exploration of the ways in which everyday lives in a city like Singapore are structured by power, possibility and psychogeography. Students will interrogate the ways public and private spaces such as housing estates, public and corporate institutions, school campuses, city streets and shopping malls structure the individual imagination. They will then explore how these spaces become infused with a myriad of personal stories, memories, fictions, poetics and possibilities.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This course is intended to deepen and widen your pre-existing knowledge of Asian or Buddhist art, and to develop critical frameworks for rethinking prevailing canons of Buddhist art. It covers a selection of artefacts, sites and works of art from over two millennia from ca. 300BCE to the 21st century. The geographical scope mirrors the internationalisation of Buddhism, from South Asia to East, Southeast Asia, and the Western world, since the first millennium. We ask: how have Buddhist teachings been interpreted by image-makers over space and time, and how have the representations been subsequently experienced, read and used, and what makes 'Buddhist art' 'Buddhist' and 'art'? These studies will provide a basis for further in-depth studies of Buddhist Art.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in film practice. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their immediate relevance to film practice in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire any necessary skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and possible solution.

Finally, you will present your response, describing your analysis, strategy, process, which will move toward your proposed film project.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the response. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Project Presentation and handin.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

This course focuses on connecting the worlds of objects, experiences and meanings through a conceptual framework. It introduces the student to the importance of juxtaposing new and contradictory design situations with the task of understanding and resolving them. Subjects are examined through a conceptual lens: studying different aspects of semantics, imagery, perception, behaviour, beliefs, culture as structural frameworks in the development of ideas. Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.

Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process:
The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.

Design as Discourse/ Critical Design:
You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

Conceptual Design projects:
You will apply conceptual and critical design methods to realize design projects based on various themes.

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.
