This course aims to introduce you to the martial arts cinemas of Asia. You will study classical and contemporary films produced by East Asian cinemas (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea), allowing you to become acquainted with the historical, institutional and cultural contexts behind these films. You will be introduced to a wide variety of Asian cinematic styles and they will learn the richness and diversity of regional film cultures as well as the respective societies of the countries featured.
