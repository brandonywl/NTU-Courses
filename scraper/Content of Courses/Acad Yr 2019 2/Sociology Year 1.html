In its widest sense, culture refers to the sum total of ways of life that are shared by members of a society, providing a sense of social order and yet changing through time. In addition to the concept of material culture, this course focuses on intangible aspects of culture such as values, norms, ideas, beliefs and symbols, which govern the conduct of social life. Culture is transmitted by the institutions and processes of  socialization and is drawn into the social construction of personal and collective identities. The course also discusses changing conceptions of selfhood in modern society and issues related to ethnocentrism, cultural relativism, subculture, global culture, popular culture, and multiculturalism.

This course develops an understanding of ethnicity as a social concept and phenomenon in which group boundaries are defined and maintained on the basis of inherited or acquired cultural characteristics (e.g., language and customs). In particular, it considers the relationship between ethnic identity and minority status in plural or multicultural societies, especially in relation to racism or other forms of discrimination. The course also examines patterns of ethnic integration, ethnic conflict and the politics of identity in different societies, especially in light of flows of new immigrants from global diasporas.

The family occupies a central place in the everyday lives of most people across societies and cultures. Yet changes in contemporary society have had a major impact on the family as a social institution. Beginning with a basic understanding of kinship patterns in human society, this course examines theoretical perspectives on the family and the diversity of family forms and households that has developed over time. It considers issues related to intimacy, marriage, divorce, parenthood (both motherhood and fatherhood), alternatives to conventional family practices, and social policies which affect family life and family planning. The politics of the family and issues such as gender inequality and domestic violence are also discussed.

Rapid advancement in science and technology presents individuals and societies with a unprecedented array of challenges. This course explores the social, ethical and policy issues associated with scientific and technological advancement by posing questions such as the following: What is science? How is scientific knowledge created, disseminated and adopted? How are discoveries and inventions made and accepted? What is the nature of scientific and technological progress? How is it influenced by social, political, economic and cultural factors? What are the roles of universities, research institutes and industrial or business partners? In examining the social implications and consequences of the new scientific ideas and technological applications, the course scrutinizes developments in multiple fields, including the life sciences, medicine, engineering and digital media.

This course provides a critical survey of key theories and issues in environmental sociology. Beginning with an overview of environmental problems in the contemporary world, we examine the social construction of nature and the development of environmentalism as a concept and a social movement. In particular, we analyze the challenges of sustainable development and the roles of the state, market, and civil society in responding to environmental issues. Specific issues such as climate change, food security, and renewable energy are studied from a sociological perspective. The course will also consider issues related to environmental inequality and environmental justice.
