This course is an experiential exploration of the ways in which everyday lives in a city like Singapore are structured by power, possibility and psychogeography. Students will interrogate the ways public and private spaces such as housing estates, public and corporate institutions, school campuses, city streets and shopping malls structure the individual imagination. They will then explore how these spaces become infused with a myriad of personal stories, memories, fictions, poetics and possibilities.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This course introduces you to a history of 'fantasy' in Western art. The nature, concepts and practice of fantastic art is explored through a series of artistic-historical periods, movements and individuals. A diversity of notions of 'fantasy' is addressed within different socio-political and historical contexts in which they were produced. This historical survey serves as a grounding for the understanding of the fantastic genre in today's artistic and media culture, which will be of use for further studies in Western Art History, as well as illustrators and animators who wish to specialize in the genre of the `fantastic'.

This course is designed to situate art and artists in a number of diverse spiritual, geographical and historical contexts and in so doing allow you to explore art history through a variety of human beliefs. This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings? to our eyes; analyze what Jocho?s Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

This course is a practical course that focuses on learning techniques and processes to create digital 3d models. There are two main types of digital modelling ? constructed and sculpted. Both approaches will be learned and explored as to their suitability for a range of outcomes. A wide range of mechanical and organic shapes will be developed, using a variety of techniques and level of detail. Surface colouring and lighting will be examined, as well as other surface attributes such as reflectivity, shininess, dullness, glow, wetness, as well as some discussion into complex surface textures such as hair.

The course will also cover a range of export and linking options in order to integrate into  a production scenario for animation, special effects, cinema or digital gaming.

This course examines the ways in which madness is interpreted in selected literature and films from late 19th century onwards. Is madness a matter of perspective, biological disorder, subversion or metaphor? We examine four possible categories: the mentally ill with self-awareness of their debilitating condition; alienated individuals deviating from societal norms; mentally unsound individuals labeled insane by experts; and individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder in enacting transgressive acts. Using close reading of literary and visual narratives, this course will discuss madness in the contexts of self-awareness, creativity, alienation and isolation, language as construct, women and representation, the institution, sexual dysfunction and violence.

This course aims to teach you to think logically and critically. It covers a broad range of logical concepts and terminology, including argument, premise, conclusion, inductive and deductive reasoning, validity, soundness, and strength. You will learn how to evaluate good deductive arguments through the study of categorical and truth functional logic, and good inductive arguments using a probabilistic framework.
Finally, you will learn about common fallacies (rhetorical, statistical, and psychological), how to avoid them, and how to clearly communicate where fallacious arguments go wrong.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

Are you OK? We often ask each other this question. We are often concerned about the psychological well-being of our family members, friends, and, most importantly ourselves. In this course, we will discuss issues concerning psychological well-being and mental health in Singapore: the early signs of not being "OK", when you might need professional help, and where you might find the appropriate help. The course will be taught by a seasoned mental health practitioner in Singapore, in collaboration with our in-house faculty members.

In today's fast-paced and competitive work environment, a student is often lost as to how and where to find jobs and how to manage one's career. This course will provide an introduction to the contemporary human resource management functions: employment, employee relations, training and development, performance systems, compensation, benefits, and human resource information systems. It is not the objective of this course to train students to be HRM managers, but to provide basic information for students to plan and manage their own careers.
