This course combines a variety of texts and gender/sexuality research theories in order to discuss issues of sex and gender/sexuality in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. These include sexual attractiveness and sexual desire in pre-Qin and Qin/Han literature, lust and eroticism in Ming/Qing literature, the destruction of family and the abandonment of marriage in early modern Chinese literature, love in friendship and the construction of masculinity, Chinese feminism and female sexual desire, new sexual morality discourse and the great debate on love, the first and second waves of feminism, and queer theory. By tracing the development and changes in Chinese concepts of gender/sexuality from ancient times to the present day, this course aims to ensure that you can, while remaining rooted in history, refer to constructions of knowledge in Western gender/sexuality culture and theory and proceed to rethink and deepen the contemporary discussion on these topics on an individual and societal level.

The aim of this course is to offer an interdisciplinary perspective on the question of why women are underrepresented in the film and TV industries. This course is most appropriate for students who have some general knowledge of film production and/or film history and theories.  Based on selected papers, book chapters, and industry publications, the course focuses on what factors might contribute to replicating this inequality as well as the different ways this might play out in different national systems and regions. The focus is on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethical issues in the industry as people discuss meaningful correctives.

We will begin with Plato's Symposium, and move on to recent theorizations and philosophies of love.  More than simply addressing thematic concerns, this course will approach love as a philosophy and a discursive practice, as well as address the issues of subjectivity, the Self-Other relation and difference, all of which are central to love. Our final aim is to evaluate the potential for love to serve as a discourse of alterity.  We will be covering a variety of discourses and texts: philosophy, psychoanalysis, feminism and literary theory; film and literary works by both male and female authors and poets.

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of' - and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

This course will explore a range of contemporary women's writing.  Two seminars will be devoted to the study of each text; one seminar will focus primarily on the text as a exemplary of "women's writing", thus dealing with the politics of gender identity, female desire and sexuality, while the next will address the text as exemplary of contemporary writing, dealing with narrative language, postmodern reality and questions of historical representation, as well as the construction of the shattered/ split postmodern subject.

Given that Introduction to Gender and Diversity is proposed as a module for a Minor programme,
it would take a broad, introductory approach to the critical  theory and its socio-political  and
historical contexts. The module will explore the intersectional constructions of gendered identity
according to a range of discourses that concern femininity, masculinity, transgendered identity, disability, ethnicity, class, nationality and virtual identities. It will consider the ways in which these discourses  underpin contemporary debates about diversity.   The  module encourages you to develop a broad  knowledge of the subjects studied and to hone your analytical  skills, with an appreciation of the conflicts and nuances inherent in discussions about diversity and gendered identities.  Furthermore, over the course of the module, you should develop articulacy and self-assurance in academic debate, both in class discussion and in written work.

British colonialism had important impacts upon colonized societies and understanding colonialism is important to understanding our contemporary post-colonial moment.  This course examines the ways different forms of colonial power intersected with race, gender and class.  With a focus on the British Empire, we will look at the manner in which colonial governments sought to settle, trade, govern, 'civilise,' know, and link the Empire.  Students will enter into debates about the nature of British colonial power: was it a unified project or unstable, violent or intimate?  We will analyse the relationship between the British metropole and the colonies, including the flow of ideas, people and goods within imperial networks and the 'counterflows' from colonial sites back to Britain.  This course also asks how colonised people interacted with British colonial governments and institutions and how race, class and gender structured interactions between and amongst the colonisers and the colonised. We will examine everyday strategies colonised people adopted, from challenging colonial power to collaboration, as well as look at settler and anti-imperialist nationalisms.  This course will examine `settler colonies' and `exploitation colonies' across the globe, but will have particular focus on colonies in Asia and the Pacific.

How do we speak the unspeakable? How do we talk about sex? Why do we talk about it the way we do? And why do we not talk about it when we don?t? Why is sex often taboo?... How do we construct our sexual subjectivities and how do we perform our sexual identities through language-in-use?... Do gays and lesbians have their own language(s)? What are the `labels? that have been applied to non-conformist sexual choices and non-heterosexual orientations throughout history? How have they changed? How and why do some of them get reclaimed and re appropriated by the very same people they were intended to offend and discriminate against? And how are some other offensive labels resisted and rejected? What are the main sociocultural and political significances of these linguistic interventions? What does language have to do with identity politics? What are the main achievements of the sexual political movements? And what are their shortcomings?... How do we verbalize our erotic desire?... How do we represent our sexuality online, and how do we construct discursively what/whom we want, or do not want?... Why are sexual jokes and innuendoes funny and/or provocative and socially disruptive even when not a single ?bad word? is used? 

These are among the questions we?ll be tackling throughout this course by examining a wide range of examples from around the world. We will critically reflect on insights and concepts from sociolinguistics, sociology, anthropology, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, literary criticism, media studies and related social sciences and humanities in order to develop an integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological toolbox which we will apply when analyzing the linguistic and discursive aspects of human sexuality. 

The course will provide ample opportunities for students to get hands-on experience by analyzing and discussing real-life language data. Students will be expected to do all the assigned readings on time, submit their reading notes and discussion questions the night before the class, and actively participate in our in-class discussions. 

Parental advisory: occasional explicit content! We will occasionally deal with ?strong language? throughout this course. The course is not suitable for those who may find such content objectionable. There will be no pornography in this course.

This course is designed to introduce students to a range of philosophical issues surrounding race and gender.  There are two main topics that we?ll be exploring in the course, each of which will occupy about half of the term.  The first topic is the multidisciplinary debate about what race and gender actually are, which we will engage with through critical examination of a range of proposed definitions of race and gender.  The second topic is the social, ethical, and political significance that race and gender, with particular attention to the ways that race and gender shape the opportunities and obstacles faced by individuals/groups in society.  By examining these issues, students will gain a better understanding of the role of race and gender in their own individual identity as well as the ability to think critically about societal policies and ideologies related to race and gender.

This course examines gender relations within various institutional contexts. Beginning with a discussion of gender difference and inequality from a sociological perspective, we consider theories of gender, including the nature of patriarchy, and the social and cultural construction of women and men. In particular, we will discuss the structural and ideological aspects of gender relations in social contexts such as the following: the family and household, work and the economy, politics and the state, and popular culture and mass media. Within these contexts, we examine specific issues, for example, the domestic division of labour, gender segregation in employment, gender representations and identities, and gender inequality in relation to crime and violence. In so doing, we also analyze the effectiveness of public policy in these areas.
