The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world?s population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

How do we speak the unspeakable? How do we talk about sex? Why do we talk about it the way we do? And why do we not talk about it when we don?t? Why is sex often taboo?... How do we construct our sexual subjectivities and how do we perform our sexual identities through language-in-use?... Do gays and lesbians have their own language(s)? What are the `labels? that have been applied to non-conformist sexual choices and non-heterosexual orientations throughout history? How have they changed? How and why do some of them get reclaimed and re appropriated by the very same people they were intended to offend and discriminate against? And how are some other offensive labels resisted and rejected? What are the main sociocultural and political significances of these linguistic interventions? What does language have to do with identity politics? What are the main achievements of the sexual political movements? And what are their shortcomings?... How do we verbalize our erotic desire?... How do we represent our sexuality online, and how do we construct discursively what/whom we want, or do not want?... Why are sexual jokes and innuendoes funny and/or provocative and socially disruptive even when not a single ?bad word? is used? 

These are among the questions we?ll be tackling throughout this course by examining a wide range of examples from around the world. We will critically reflect on insights and concepts from sociolinguistics, sociology, anthropology, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, literary criticism, media studies and related social sciences and humanities in order to develop an integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological toolbox which we will apply when analyzing the linguistic and discursive aspects of human sexuality. 

The course will provide ample opportunities for students to get hands-on experience by analyzing and discussing real-life language data. Students will be expected to do all the assigned readings on time, submit their reading notes and discussion questions the night before the class, and actively participate in our in-class discussions. 

Parental advisory: occasional explicit content! We will occasionally deal with ?strong language? throughout this course. The course is not suitable for those who may find such content objectionable. There will be no pornography in this course.

Like so many other aspects of life, language communication has been revolutionised by the introduction of the Internet. This course explores how the structure and use of English have been shaped by the popularity of new modes of communication made available by the Internet: SMS, e-mail, chatrooms, Internet Relay Chat, Usenet newsgroups, World Wide Web pages, and virtual worlds. The implications of these changes for our thinking and understanding of language will also be discussed.

This course is designed to provide a theoretical frame and language reconstruction training in Toponymy and Toponomastics, both at the level of the historical reconstruction of the origins and original meanings of place names all over the world (in different historical and geographical contexts) and in the evaluation of the relations between Toponymy and human societies. Students will be provided with an overall view on the study of Diachronic Toponymy (undocumented and endangered linguistic contexts) and Historical Toponomastics (linguistic contexts with available historical sources and records) and on their relevance in the reconstruction of proto-languages and in hypothesizing the existence of pre-languages.

The course introduces fundamental topics in Orality in Linguistics and Oral Culture and Literature. It would consist of a basic introduction to linguistic strategies in the transmission of traditional knowledge in preliterate cultures all over the world, from Antiquity (Homer and the Homeric poems), to the Middle Ages (the Irish Filid, the original Old Norse poetry), to our times (the Serbian Guslari, the studies on orality by Marcel Jousse), plus a specific focus on indigenous cultures in Australia and Africa, and in South-East Asia.
The course will provide the students with a general and accurate overview of the above-mentioned topics, associating notions of Language Documentation and Language Description with elements of Anthropological Linguistics, Philology, and Comparative Literature. 

The course examines the epistemological issue of orality, culture, and literacy both from the point of view of basic original and theoretical principles established by the best scholars in this discipline (from Milman Parry, to Albert Lord, to Eric Havelock, to Marcel Jousse, to John Foley, to Ruth Finnegan, to Edgard Sienaert), and from the point of view of the direct analysis of examples of oral `unwritten texts? and oral strategies in handing down the traditional knowledge.

The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of Theoretical Linguistics and Comparative Literature. Particular attention will be given to the analysis of a number of methodological `milestones? in the study on orality, culture, and literacy, in particular to The Anthropology of Gesture by Marcel Jousse and to works by Milman Parry, Eric Havelock, Albert Lord, and Ruth Finnegan. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of orality, language, and literature in a historical and theoretical way, not only analyzing the related general issues, but also dealing with the direct application of basic principles in reading and interpreting `unwritten texts? of oral traditions from all over the world.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

The course explores the interaction of language and culture from linguistic, sociological and anthropological points of view. Using linguistic and social theories as a basis, this course will demonstrate how the treatment of language and culture issues might pose a danger of propagating stereotypes. It will also question the transference and translation of languages across cultures. Pragmatic theories will be also used to explain the causes of cross-cultural misunderstandings. Other topics discussed include the role of prosody and nonverbal behaviour in communication; factors influencing conversational style in different discourse contexts; the negotiation of power and solidarity in intercultural communication; the socialisation of language, and the creation of an identity from a child language acquisition perspective.

Do languages of the world have any features in common? Are there universals of language that can be discovered through careful comparisons and contrasts of different languages? And how have languages been classified? This course provides an introduction to how linguists have tackled these and related questions. Theories of language universals will be reviewed, and schemes of language classification examined.

This course is about the study of transactions between individuals and their physical settings. In these transactions, individuals change the environment, and their behavior and experiences are changed by the environment. Environmental psychology includes theory, research, and practice aimed at improving your relationship with the natural environment. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and natural environment is crucial for those of you who desire to work not only at environmental agencies but also at engineering, city planning, or policymaking. 

The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand environmental psychology ? the understanding of person-environment transactions and the application of that understanding to solve real-world problems that most or even all people face. To achieve this goal, you will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal characteristics that filter or digest external factors. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every human activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

This course provides an introduction to psychological perspectives on criminal and antisocial
behavior. It will also incorporate knowledge from interdisciplinary areas to examine the interplay
between psychological,social, and biological factors in predisposing to crime and violence. Different developmental trajectories and forms of crime and criminals will be discussed.
Throughout the course, we will also attempt to bridge the basic science of criminal behavior with the real world through case studies and discussion of the implications of psychological and criminological research for the criminal justice system. The content of this course deals with the
developmental, neuroscience, clinical, social, and cognitive subdivisions of psychology.
