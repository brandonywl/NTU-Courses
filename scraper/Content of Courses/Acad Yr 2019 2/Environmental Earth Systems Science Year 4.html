In today's competitive world, it is essential that students learn the crucial career skills early to ensure a competitive edge sharpened with a heightened sense of workplace values and ethics.  This course takes students through a journey of career discovery, understanding and polishing of oneself which will then be translated into job application tools such as resumes and interview skills. 

All students will have the opportunity to undergo a robust Career Assessment Tool, which assesses their career options and career self and helps them chart a career action plan. They will also learn how to identify and articulate the concept of personal branding and applying that to resumes and interviews and online social media. Students will also be exposed to the basics of grooming to ensure that they are aware of the importance of first impressions in all situations.
