This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.
