This course builds upon basic biological knowledge covered in foundational undergraduate courses, and focuses on the dynamics of species populations, and the interactions between organisms and their environment.  Besides covering the theory and mechanisms in the respective concepts, the course explicitly links the former to real-world phenomena and applications.  Topics are taught with linkages to the current school curricula.

The aim of this workshop is to train students to apply proteomic strategy to biological and biomedical research. Students will use tissue and blood samples from large animal (pig and/or dog) models of ischemia heart disease to discover molecular biomarker and disease mechanism by analyzing the samples using mass spectromertry-based proteomic approach. Students won?t handle or do operation on the animal. The tissue and blood samples will be provided by a cardiac research laboratory. At the start of each day, a seminar will be presented by the faculty in-charge to allow students to understand the experiment and to learn the principles of various proteomic methods to be used. Then, the faculty in-charge and teaching assistants will teach the students how to prepare and analyze the proteomic samples, and how to apply bioinformatic tools for data analysis and interpretation. In this practical workshop, students will learn protein extraction and purification using mass spectrometry compatible buffers, shotgun proteomic sample preparation, HPLC protein separation and fractionation, hand-on mass spectrometry skills, mass spectrometry data interpretation, protein sequence database search for protein identification and post-translational modifications characterization. Students will also learn data mining to discover biomarker candidates and underlying molecular disease mechanism. At the end of every day, students will need to collate and discuss their data with the faculty in-charge. This will be conducted in the SMART classrooms. At the end of the course, students will need to submit a report and make presentations that will be graded by the faculty in-charge. As there is a limitation of the mass spectrometry instrument time for this course, the maximum class size will be constrained to 15 students.

Metabolites, including lipids, are mediators of biological processes and imbalance in metabolism is associated with diverse human pathology, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration as well as infection. Targeting metabolism is an attractive approach for treatment of some of these diseases. The field of metabolomics/ lipidomics have emerged, with the goal to provide the systems-level view of the complex metabolic networks which need to be kept in check to maintain a healthy state. This one-week course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in metabolomics and lipidomics. The course will focus on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisition and analyses using classical as well as novel lipidomics and metabolomics approaches. Here, you will perform extraction and analyses of lipids/ metabolites from cells treated with various drugs to investigate the impact of these drugs on cellular metabolism. You will process and analyse the metabolomics/ lipidomics datasets using open-source software(s). The knowledge will equip you for future works on metabolism and health, as well as advance graduate studies.

The aim of this course is to understand pathologic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular and cellular level. The hallmark of those aging-associated diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, is protein aggregation that occurs when protein homeostasis collapses. Cellular protein homeostasis is maintained by regulating protein synthesis, folding and degradation. Therefore, this course will address the whole life cycle of proteins and you will learn how failure of each step of the cycle is linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Various genes and pathways involved in aging are also an important topic of the course. This course will help you understand why debilitating neurodegenerative diseases are on the increase in our society and how to approach to cure them.

This 13-week course provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in Good Manufacturing Practice for medical devices. The main area of concentration is in the United States (US) Quality System Regulation (QSR), which has influenced much of how quality systems are managed today including the ISO13485. The course presents the US QSR in detail giving examples on how to apply each requirement. You will understand how to construct quality documentation for medical device manufacturing. The second part of this course teaches three essential sterilisation methods commonly used in the medical device industry. These are steam, ethylene oxide and radiation sterilisation, including the vital aspects of sterilisation validation.

In today's competitive world, it is essential that students learn the crucial career skills early to ensure a competitive edge sharpened with a heightened sense of workplace values and ethics.  This course takes students through a journey of career discovery, understanding and polishing of oneself which will then be translated into job application tools such as resumes and interview skills. 

All students will have the opportunity to undergo a robust Career Assessment Tool, which assesses their career options and career self and helps them chart a career action plan. They will also learn how to identify and articulate the concept of personal branding and applying that to resumes and interviews and online social media. Students will also be exposed to the basics of grooming to ensure that they are aware of the importance of first impressions in all situations.
