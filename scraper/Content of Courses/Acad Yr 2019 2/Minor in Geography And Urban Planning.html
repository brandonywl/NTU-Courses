This course is an experiential exploration of the ways in which everyday lives in a city like Singapore are structured by power, possibility and psychogeography. Students will interrogate the ways public and private spaces such as housing estates, public and corporate institutions, school campuses, city streets and shopping malls structure the individual imagination. They will then explore how these spaces become infused with a myriad of personal stories, memories, fictions, poetics and possibilities.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

Environmental issues have entered the centre of international politics and global governance in the recent two decades. This course is to introduce global environmental politics and governance (actors, institutions, mechanisms, norms and power dynamics) to students, and examine the topic by a typology of three categories: global common pool resource, transboundary environmental disputes, and local accumulative environmental change. The course encourages and mentors student?s independent research and critical thinking beyond readings and classroom discussion by assigning them into groups and conduct in-depth case studies, taking them to visit an environmental organization with global outreach and impact, and guiding them to incorporate first-hand observation into systemic learning. Via multiple learning sources and innovative teaching methods, the course aims at opening a compound, dynamic and interdisciplinary field to the students.

This course aims to familiarise you with major historical and contemporary issues impacting politics in developing countries and equip you with a theoretically-informed understanding of multiple development challenges they face.
The course is designed for students who are interested in development issues but have no substantial background on the discipline.
By introducing you to development studies, HA3005 is a first step for those of you who are considering a future career in national aid agencies, multilateral development agencies (UNDP,UNICEF, UNESCO, FAO,WB, IMF, AllB ...), development related NGOs (OXFAM, Al, HRW...) or becoming social entrepreneurs.

This course provides a critical survey of key theories and issues in environmental sociology. Beginning with an overview of environmental problems in the contemporary world, we examine the social construction of nature and the development of environmentalism as a concept and a social movement. In particular, we analyze the challenges of sustainable development and the roles of the state, market, and civil society in responding to environmental issues. Specific issues such as climate change, food security, and renewable energy are studied from a sociological perspective. The course will also consider issues related to environmental inequality and environmental justice.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.

This course examines themes, concepts, theories, and trends which define the study of international development from a critical geographical perspective. Students will gain an understanding of the historical and contemporary challenges of global inequality with reference to specific case studies. We shall be discussing what Development means by examining different development pathways and strategies throughout the global economy. While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems.

Borders and bordering processes are a fundamental field of study within human geography and adjacent fields of social science. This course is designed for Geography and Urban Planning students to begin exploring the basic theoretical and empirical elements of borders in a variety of contexts. This will help you understand the workings of our world, undertake more advanced courses in this program, and prepare for future careers that involve bordering processes, such as design, planning, politics, policy, and tourism.
