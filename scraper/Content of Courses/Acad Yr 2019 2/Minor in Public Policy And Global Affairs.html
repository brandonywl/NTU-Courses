'The Asian Century' is the buzz word that many pundits and experts use in describing East Asia in the 21st Century. Given the rapid economic development in the region, propelled by China and the Southeast Asian states with the United States, Japan, and South Korea as the established economies, Asia has a great potential to lead the world economies. However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.'
This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism. We will discuss the concept of 'East Asia' and ?International Security; history of East Asian security; US 'hub-and-spoke' system, particularly the US-Japan alliance; ASEAN multilateralism, particularly ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and East Asia Summit; advanced theoretical frameworks to make sense of East Asian security; and regional security issues, such as the Rise of China, the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, East and South China Sea. In order to foster discussions in the class, students need to catch up with contemporary East Asian affairs, through Newspaper, Magazines, and on-line media. By the end of this class, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in East Asia and be able to use international relations theory to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to resolve them.

This seminar aims to offer students the in-depth, comprehensive knowledge and analyses of potentials, strengths, and limitations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through class discussions, students will learn history, characteristics, and functions of ASEAN from the material and ideational perspectives. With these knowledge, students will gain an ability to analyze the ASEAN?s utility (potentials and limitations) and raison d'etre by employing not only International Relations (IR) theories, but also theories in other fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, history). Those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations and Asian/Southeast Asian studies or career in foreign affairs and international relations should take this course, since this becomes a rigid intellectual foundation of ASEAN studies.

Students will review public administration literature developed in different times. Through the lens of chronology, students will be able to compare critical thinking in the late 1800s, early 1900s, between two World Wars, during Cold War, New Public Management era, and today. By taking this course, students will be able to clearly define public administration, especially its relationships with other related disciplines. More importantly, they are expected to draw a big picture of public administration in the next decade.

This course introduces students to the politics and policies of European integration. The European Union, one of the most established international regional organisations in the world, has been an institution in the making for 60 years. The policies adopted at the supranational level now affect more than 500 million citizens of 28 countries; the bilateral and multilateral relationships that EU member states form are subject to the scrutiny of central institutions such as the European Commission, European Parliament, and the European Court of Justice, among others. By taking this course, students will learn about the historical motivations that led to the emergence of the European Union (and what alternative models were considered), the design and structure of European institutions (and how they have evolved over time), the core policy areas regulated at the EU level (and why some are outside of the formal EU institutional framework), as well as extant theories that attempt to capture these complex and multilevel interactions.

This course is designed to provide you with a general introduction to certain of the most significant traditions within the field of political theory. It focuses in particular on the relationship between normative political thought and the methodologies deployed in the production and study of this thought. Within the field of political theory, questions regarding method tend to be obscured or ignored by practitioners and students alike. This course will thus aim to correct this lack by highlighting some of the most important methodological approaches to the practice of political theory. It will examine both the theoretical assumptions guiding the various methods, as well as how the methods are concretely applied in the formulation and analysis of political thought. Examples of methodological traditions that will be studied include: analytic political philosophy, realism, esotericism, contextualism, dialectical analysis, immanent critique, hermeneutics, genealogy, and comparative political theory.

This course introduces you to foreign affairs through a series of simulations, discussions where you will become acquainted with the practice of statecraft and diplomacy on a practical level. From the perspective of policymakers, we will tackle several of the most pressing issues in contemporary international security, ranging from traditional security issues like inter-state and civil war, nuclear proliferation, and the rise of great powers to more non-traditional, newer issues like terrorism, climate change, and 'human security.'  You will explore the intricacies, challenges, and possibilities of diplomacy during international crises through an active learning approach using simulations.
