This course introduces the core components of motion picture production: idea, image, sound, and sequence.  In lecture, students will view movies and/or television programmes while considering a variety of questions.  What do we want to express?  Who is our audience?  How do we talk about images?  What compositional elements can we control or manipulate? How do we sequence images in order to evoke specific responses?  What happens when particular sounds and images are juxtaposed?  In related tutorials, students will explore these concepts with digital video cameras and nonlinear editing.

To better understand how and why communication occurs and what effects it has, it is necessary to get inside the "black box" of the human mind. Therefore, this course will concentrate on studying cognitive processes and their relationship to media and communication. While some attention will be paid to the psychological aspects of interpersonal communication, the primary the goal of the course is to develop an understanding of media from a psychological perspective. That is, the course will examine how perception, attention, memory, attitudes and emotion are related to the experience of mediated communication. These psychological responses will be examined in a range of contexts and communication functions including news and information, advertising and persuasion, and entertainment. This will help students become both better producers of media and more critical users.

This course serves as an introduction to information analytics. It is divided into two parts. First, critical to understanding information analytics is the larger ecosystem in which the field is interconnected with. Thus, related technologies are discussed, including IT infrastructure, databases, the Internet, Web and social media, as well as mobile and ubiquitous computing.  Second, the course examines the various techniques that have been employed in capturing, storing, accessing and analyzing large amounts of data, as well as software tools available for these tasks. As part of this course, examples of how information analytics have been applied to the information, communication, media and related industries will be covered.

The aim of this course is to introduce students to the concepts, techniques and technologies associated with information visualization and presentation. The course will firstly provide the foundation of information visualization and visual representations can help in the analysis and understanding of data and information. Thereafter, the course introduces design techniques to provide an understanding of how to design effective visualizations and presentations focusing on human visual perception and media components. This course would be of interest to students who would like to develop practical and conceptual skills on design principles and techniques for visualizing information.

In the age of big data, organisations are collecting huge amounts of data/information of different types from a variety of sources. The data/information need to be organised and represented in appropriate forms to support intelligent applications as well as human decision making. The course seeks to impart competencies for representing information and knowledge using Internet technologies including RDF (Resource Description Framework), OWL 2 (Web Ontology Language) and metadata schemes; representing datasets in data-interchange formats including XML, JSON and Turtle; organizing information using classification schemes, taxonomies and controlled vocabulary; using appropriate software tools for ontology authoring, data formatting, and graphical visualization. The course is appropriate for students from any background who has an inclination for detailed content analysis, logical reasoning, linguistic analysis, data analytics or text mining.

The course introduces students to the quantitative aspects of media planning. Topics covered will include brand analysis, audience analysis, market segmentation, and media analysis. Case studies and real-life practices will be included in this class. During the first half of the semester, students will conduct a brand audit and develop and administer a survey to determine target audience media usage. The information from the brand audit and market survey will then be used to compile a strategic media plan. Strategies and recommendations will form the basis of the media plan.  
 
The course will be taught in an active learning fashion. It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building. All students are expected to be active and proactive in course activities.

This course aims to introduce you to the martial arts cinemas of Asia. You will study classical and contemporary films produced by East Asian cinemas (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea), allowing you to become acquainted with the historical, institutional and cultural contexts behind these films. You will be introduced to a wide variety of Asian cinematic styles and they will learn the richness and diversity of regional film cultures as well as the respective societies of the countries featured. Due to the wide range of films and countries covered in this course, you are encouraged to view each lecture as a critical introduction to pertinent critical issues within each national cinema rather than a comprehensive overview of each film culture. Therefore, you are expected to use the various lectures as starting points for more in-depth research on particular films and national cultures. 
This course introduces a range of Asian cinemas and specific films in the genre of martial arts cinema to foster awareness and intercultural communication.
1.	Generic analysis of films from the prism of intercultural awareness
2.	Application of knowledge through discussions and tests of study cases

This is a module for advanced students addressing the question, 'How does film relate to society and politics?' It focuses on the medium itself and on the nature of the medium as it relates to both political and documentary subjects. The module therefore is designed to show and teach students the double aspects of film, firstly, to reflect reality and, secondly, to tackle political topics with highly contentious subjective techniques. While films are generally seen as a leisure activity, the cinema cannot be divorced from society and the pressing issues of our times. It can function as a forum in which viewers are not only entertained but informed and educated and cognitively prepared to develop good citizenship. The audience is presented with topics and issues of great concern in the community, which are often controversial, and certainly provocative. This module seeks to stimulate and inspire students towards a more critical view of cinema as a medium that challenges viewing practices and cognitive senses through the content of the films. Students will be taught to understand the cinema as a medium of social communication, presenting stories that question our views of society and politics. 

The module will familiarize students with a range of cinematic works, key readings and important trends in contemporary global cinema and, secondly, to develop critical tools and skills in analyzing contemporary films with respect to both their aesthetic properties and their various historical, social, political determinants.

The course is concerned with researching and producing short overseas digital documentaries underpinned by an introduction to the field of visual anthropology. Short documentaries engage both the heart and the intellect presenting a picture of the world, or at least a part of it. British documentarian John Grierson described it is a creative treatment of 'actuality', and that means it is grounded in real life, or in fact.
You will look at locations in the world for, inspiration, personal stories and authenticity, and you will learn about the broader social, cultural and economic implications of the location but also about this particular type of filmmaking. The course, therefore, has both an academic slant as well as a practical one.
The skills developed will be transferable to other forms of study whether it be digital filmmaking, journalism or another communication field. It will expand your powers of observation and description; of understanding local cultures and humankind; and of self-reflection on the role and responsibilities of a digital documentarian as a representative of your home country and an observer and commentator on a host country.
