This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

This course will introduce you to the history of cultures of the Asia-Pacific regions covering the period from the rise of the state until 1800 with a focus on everyday life for the ruling classes and their subject populations. In addition to scholarly accounts of family life, state-formation, sexuality, economics, and religion, you will read literature from a variety of contexts in order to develop an intimate relationship with the individuals and groups in each culture. This literature will include ancient Indian epic, Confucian texts on the state and family, the Komasatra, and stories from the Tang and Song dynasties. In this course, you will also consider modern anthropological parallels in order to bring to life the familial, cultural, social, and political worlds of pre-colonial India, China, and Southeast Asia.

In this class, students will become familiar with what some historians term 'The American Irony' - that American citizens have consistently acquired independence, freedom, and affluence by conquering, enslaving, and impoverishing other peoples. Students will explore the major events that shaped the development of the United States, from the colonial period through the War on Terror. In the process they will learn how the United States rose to a position of global hegemony, and question whether that situation is likely to endure. This class will particularly focus on issues of race, class, and gender, which carry relevance beyond the boundaries of the United States.

In this course, you will investigate the historical development of Muslim societies from the classical period to the present. You will analyze diverse theories and practices of Muslim communities that span a global scale while being embedded in their own local political, economic and social contexts. This course will equip you to conceptualize the basic precepts and terminology that define the idea of an Islamicate World while inviting you to critique this notion through empirical historical evidence. You will also develop your skills in analyzing and interpreting primary and secondary sources, particularly through close readings of how Islamic concepts are employed in literary and political rhetoric.

Much of what we see in current day East Asia finds its roots in centuries past.  This course introduces students to the history of modern East Asia through the main themes of tradition and transformation. Tracing from the 1500s to the present day, this course examines how China, Japan and Korea emerged as modern nation states. A thematic approach is combined with a chronological one, giving both the historical context of events but at the same time a wider appreciation of phenomena such as the rise of nationalism, modernisation, and the idea of reform versus revolution. One over-arching theme we?ll also consider is that of the Western efforts over the past two centuries to open and integrate Asian nations into a global diplomatic and economic system.

British colonialism had important impacts upon colonized societies and understanding colonialism is important to understanding our contemporary post-colonial moment.  This course examines the ways different forms of colonial power intersected with race, gender and class.  With a focus on the British Empire, we will look at the manner in which colonial governments sought to settle, trade, govern, 'civilise,' know, and link the Empire.  Students will enter into debates about the nature of British colonial power: was it a unified project or unstable, violent or intimate?  We will analyse the relationship between the British metropole and the colonies, including the flow of ideas, people and goods within imperial networks and the 'counterflows' from colonial sites back to Britain.  This course also asks how colonised people interacted with British colonial governments and institutions and how race, class and gender structured interactions between and amongst the colonisers and the colonised. We will examine everyday strategies colonised people adopted, from challenging colonial power to collaboration, as well as look at settler and anti-imperialist nationalisms.  This course will examine `settler colonies' and `exploitation colonies' across the globe, but will have particular focus on colonies in Asia and the Pacific.

There are approximately 46 million ethnic Chinese living outside the Mainland, Hong
Kong, Taiwan and Macau today. This course will examine the emergence and
transformation of Chinese international migration in the global context of China`s
interactions with the outside world and diaspora`s changing patterns of political, social
and cultural adaptations. Although it will trace the historical origins of modern Chinese
migration dating back to the mid-19th century, this course focuses on the post-1945 era,
particularly the period after 1978 when China began its economic reform and openingup.
Apart from examining the linkages with the homeland and transnational ties that
connect the Chinese diaspora globally, this course pays special attention to the regions
of Asia, Europe and North America. The central themes to be explored in this courses
include the historicity of modern Chinese migration, changing faces/fates of
Chineseness, complex ethnic and cultural identities and the emergence of Chinese
transnationalism, cross-border social and business networks, diaspora`s role in China`s
economic development and foreign relations, and comparative and theoretical
approaches to Chinese international migration.

This course covers modern business history, drawing on case studies from the UK, Europe, America and Asia. This course takes a comparative approach to explore the development of modern businesses across Western and Asian societies. Business historians investigate both small and large enterprises and their management practices.
Importantly, they also consider the economic, political and social environments in which these businesses operate; this will also be our approach over the semester. The scope of this course is from the late 18th Century through until present times; we`ll trace the 10 development of modern business and business networks in Europe, UK, America and Asia. Case studies from historical and contemporary sources allows students to see the relevance of this field of study to our understanding of businesses in the present day.

In this class, students will explore the innovative field of marine environmental history. They will discover that, although oceans appear pristine and timeless, human societies have been modifying marine environments for centuries. In turn, these modified environments have shaped the course of human history. Students will examine how numerous societies around the world and through time have developed relationships with the sea, some of them sustainable and some of them not. Students will also learn about the complex systems of international cooperation that have emerged to facilitate the conservation of mobile marine species. Finally, students will learn how perceptions of oceans and ocean creatures have changed in response to cultural and scientific developments.

Many people, including historians of science in earlier ages, believed that science and religion are contraries. Science is often considered the paradigm of humans' rational thoughts that fight
against all kinds of ignorance, bigotry, and superstition, which may include religious thoughts and practices. However, many historians of science after the late twentieth century have found that the relationship between science and religion is far more complex. In some cases, religions do hamper and suppress some scientists' claims and activities, but religions can also be a positive factor in the construction of scientific ideas and worldviews, including those for the rise of modern science. This course aims at your deeper understanding of this complexity in a historical depth.

Asceticism is an intense negotiation of the self with its desires, usually taking the form of the attempt to repress or curtail sexual desire. Asceticism is often misunderstood as a radical response to the problem of obsessive desire. Excessive attachments to sex, food, and money are among the most common of these concerns?today we refer to these as addictions?both in the contemporary world and to those living in a pre-modern context. In this course, we will discuss the experiences of ascetic figures throughout history not as relics of history but as intelligible responses to the problem of obsessive desire common to all ages. We will examine case studies of ascetic practices from ancient and modern India, Southeast Asia, medieval China and Japan, and the ancient and medieval Christian worlds. The first part of the course will be devoted to understanding some of the most notable social science approaches to ascetic behavior in the field of religion while the second part of the course will be devoted to close readings of case studies in light of these theoretical approaches. Cross-cultural comparison and contrast will be stressed. In the final part of the course, we will turn to modern conceptions of asceticism, attempting to answer the question?does the ascetic response to obsessive desire make sense in the world we live in today?

At its height in the 1920s, the British Empire covered almost a quarter of the earth's area, and yet soon after, by the 1940s and 50s, newly independent nation states were emerging from the end of Britain's empire. Just in Africa, more than fifty new states were created in the 1950s. In this course, we will map the economic, social, political, and cultural histories of this foundational shift in the twentieth century called decolonization.

This module examines how the region of South Asia has interacted with the rest of Asia and with other parts of the world. In this course, we will track the complexity of these interregional connections through a focus on empire, oceans, slavery, labor flows, law, pilgrimages, migration, and diaspora. These interconnections are as varied as they are complex, but they allow us to rethink the history of South Asia as part of both an interregional arena and a world system.

What do Olympic protests, Nazi fashion, Cultural Revolution operas, and The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye have in common? All are examples used in this upper-division World History course to probe the global intersections of popular culture and politics since the 19th century. By examining theatre, television, film, artworks, literature, broadcast media, sports, fashion, and other popular cultural expressions through the lens of critical theory, you will gain a better appreciation of how states, revolutionary movements, citizens, consumers, and emerging media have originated, shaped, and resolved contentious debates over popular culture. Topics include such issues as cultural appropriation, boycotts, propaganda and censorship. In the process, you will gain a deeper understanding of global social, cultural and political history and critical approaches to culture, while developing skill in the use of historical sources and in written and oral expression. This course will thus prove useful to anyone involved not only in public history but communication and the arts.

This course is designed with the aim of enabling Arts and Humanities students to carefully research and analyze texts, reflect on them, and write disciplinarily appropriate essays.  The basic premise of the course is that effective writing in the Arts and Humanities is based on excellent, informed, and interdisciplinary analysis of original texts.  Students will be exposed to a variety of primary texts from their own discipline, as well as those of other disciplines in the Arts and Humanities, and taught how to approach and analyze them.  They will furthermore be taught how to incorporate and use arguments from secondary sources, how to develop strong research questions, and how to research and put together a strong research paper. Throughout, the course emphasizes a consideration of the how other disciplines contribute to research in their own discipline.
