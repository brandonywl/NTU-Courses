The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

The social context of the workplace is changing rapidly.  These changes place new demands on leaders to influence people effectively to achieve the desired outcomes.  The course aims to provide final year undergraduate students with an appreciation of the new demands of leadership in the workplace. Using a mix of lectures and workshops supplemented with leadership assessments and coaching assignments, students will gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the effectiveness of leadership in organisations.  The course will also provide students with a greater self-awareness of themselves as leaders - their motivation to lead, their values and  personality, and their leadership-related beliefs.  The course will also provide students with an opportunity to clarify their philosophy of leadership in order to prepare them for leadership roles in the future work environment.

The course is not only relevant for would-be entrepreneurs, but also for those considering a career in commercial banks, investment banks, private equity firms, venture capital firms, as well as in corporate venture investments. This course differs from a typical corporate finance course in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new ventures and young companies. Many typical avenues of funding (such as bank borrowing, issuing of bonds or issuing of liquid equities) for established or public listed companies are not accessible to small and young companies due to the lack of business track record. The analyses and requirements of investors who are considering providing finances to small and young companies may also be different from that of public equity investments. This course will provide students with the understanding of various aspects and processes in financial planning and financial management of new ventures or young companies, as well as investment analyses and considerations for investors providing funding to such companies.

This course is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current law for the protection of electronic information and electronic content as forms of property. Conversely this course also looks at the potential liability for misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. 

The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis,  interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with trademarks and brands embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works. This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in IP law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication ? or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the center of firms' decision making. This course helps students to understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing.  In addition, a strong relational approach is used in oppose to a transactional view of marketing.  Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions. Due to the limitation of the course duration, it is impossible to provide a how-to for managing all these relationships. Instead the course looks closer into the topic of customer relationship management and provides students with the tools and techniques to effectively use CRM.

Singapore is a small nation state with limited market opportunities. Many multinational companies have their regional headquarters in Singapore and many local companies are looking to expand overseas. This course aims to address your needs and aspirations as a marketing graduate in this globally connected world. A regional or global role will open up many career options for you and help you grow as a marketing professional. 

The first half of the course will cover familiar topics like marketing research and customer-driven marketing strategy from a global perspective. There are additional challenges that companies will face in a global context. The course will challenge your preexisting assumptions about how marketing works and help you navigate all these additional complexities of global marketing. As it is a course targeted at final-year marketing students, you will also be introduced to current concepts and ideas (e.g., design thinking) relevant to the industry to help you ease into the dynamic world of marketing. The course will also delve into how technology is transforming how companies market their products and services across borders. The first half of the course will provide grounding for the second part of the course. 

The second half of this course will seek to address the global marketing challenges facing Asian companies, and why they must learn to become global marketing/business competitors. In particular, it seeks to provide students with some insightful perspectives on how Asian companies can begin on their journeys to become global competitors. Asian companies must learn to adapt to the fast-changing rules of global competition, when many of these rules are enacted by the West. The recent sagas against Chinese companies on toys, milk products, textiles and other related products are examples for Asian companies to realize that they cannot operate independently of international opinions, norms, and sensitivities. Without a doubt, Asian companies must continue to improve their management and learn to strategize better to effectively deal with the West. They need to improve their global competitiveness, learn to build world-class businesses and brands, and how to establish sustainable global companies in order to rival the Western multi-national corporations. There will be a couple of sessions in which you will be exposed to how Sun Zi Bingfa can be applied to global business strategies. Given the rising economic power of China, Sun Zi Bingfa can provide a useful insight into the mind of the Chinese corporate strategist.
