Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

This is an entry-level course that focuses on creation of films that allow experimentation in various stages of filmmaking processes, including the development of various alternate forms of (non) narrative story structures. You will be exposed to a range of conceptual and production strategies in experimental film using key historical and contemporary examples and then put those ideas into practice through exercises and projects in order to develop your own experimental film practice. Experience and knowledge gained in this module will provide a basis for further more developed experimental film production, as well as complementing research into this field.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

This course aims to introduce you to the martial arts cinemas of Asia. You will study classical and contemporary films produced by East Asian cinemas (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea), allowing you to become acquainted with the historical, institutional and cultural contexts behind these films. You will be introduced to a wide variety of Asian cinematic styles and they will learn the richness and diversity of regional film cultures as well as the respective societies of the countries featured. Due to the wide range of films and countries covered in this course, you are encouraged to view each lecture as a critical introduction to pertinent critical issues within each national cinema rather than a comprehensive overview of each film culture. Therefore, you are expected to use the various lectures as starting points for more in-depth research on particular films and national cultures. 
This course introduces a range of Asian cinemas and specific films in the genre of martial arts cinema to foster awareness and intercultural communication.
1.	Generic analysis of films from the prism of intercultural awareness
2.	Application of knowledge through discussions and tests of study cases

This is a module for advanced students addressing the question, 'How does film relate to society and politics?' It focuses on the medium itself and on the nature of the medium as it relates to both political and documentary subjects. The module therefore is designed to show and teach students the double aspects of film, firstly, to reflect reality and, secondly, to tackle political topics with highly contentious subjective techniques. While films are generally seen as a leisure activity, the cinema cannot be divorced from society and the pressing issues of our times. It can function as a forum in which viewers are not only entertained but informed and educated and cognitively prepared to develop good citizenship. The audience is presented with topics and issues of great concern in the community, which are often controversial, and certainly provocative. This module seeks to stimulate and inspire students towards a more critical view of cinema as a medium that challenges viewing practices and cognitive senses through the content of the films. Students will be taught to understand the cinema as a medium of social communication, presenting stories that question our views of society and politics. 

The module will familiarize students with a range of cinematic works, key readings and important trends in contemporary global cinema and, secondly, to develop critical tools and skills in analyzing contemporary films with respect to both their aesthetic properties and their various historical, social, political determinants.

The aim of this course is to offer an interdisciplinary perspective on the question of why women are underrepresented in the film and TV industries. This course is most appropriate for students who have some general knowledge of film production and/or film history and theories.  Based on selected papers, book chapters, and industry publications, the course focuses on what factors might contribute to replicating this inequality as well as the different ways this might play out in different national systems and regions. The focus is on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethical issues in the industry as people discuss meaningful correctives.

The module is desgined to teach you how to analyse films as depositories of serious content, dealing with social problems and current affairs. The films shown will cover a range of genres including action-adventure, satirical, semi-documentary, as well as documentary. You will address the question of how film relates to society and deals with pressing issues of current concern.
Each week the course will introduce a key film to be watched by the students in class. This will be followed by a brief lecture and discussion, seminar style. You will be required to assess the weekly reading pertinent to the specific topic introduced each week.

This course considers the manner in which art responds to war, and the ways in which war and violence are appropriated in both aesthetic and critical discourse. We will examine the centrality of war to human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to:

	the structural constitution of war
	the differences and similarities between war and violence
	the inherent ambivalence of war
	semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war
	artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture
	Just War or just war?
	visual vs textual representations

This course is about more than just literature adaptations. In what ways, we shall ask, are texts transformed from one genre to another? If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature.
This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature. You will learn to analyze film adaptations and assess their impact on the reception of the source texts. It develops your skills in close reading, trains you in the theory and practice of adaptation, and enhances your knowledge and understanding of genre. Please refer to the planned weekly schedule for a specific list of topics.
