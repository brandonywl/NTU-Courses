Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Market intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting both internal and external sources of marketing information so as to enable the company to better understand the market environment in which it competes, thus equipping managers with the timely knowledge to make well-informed marketing decisions in a dynamic environment. Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the center of firms' decision making. This course helps students to understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing.  In addition, a strong relational approach is used in oppose to a transactional view of marketing.  Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions. Due to the limitation of the course duration, it is impossible to provide a how-to for managing all these relationships. Instead the course looks closer into the topic of customer relationship management and provides students with the tools and techniques to effectively use CRM.

Singapore is a small nation state with limited market opportunities. Many multinational companies have their regional headquarters in Singapore and many local companies are looking to expand overseas. This course aims to address your needs and aspirations as a marketing graduate in this globally connected world. A regional or global role will open up many career options for you and help you grow as a marketing professional. 

The first half of the course will cover familiar topics like marketing research and customer-driven marketing strategy from a global perspective. There are additional challenges that companies will face in a global context. The course will challenge your preexisting assumptions about how marketing works and help you navigate all these additional complexities of global marketing. As it is a course targeted at final-year marketing students, you will also be introduced to current concepts and ideas (e.g., design thinking) relevant to the industry to help you ease into the dynamic world of marketing. The course will also delve into how technology is transforming how companies market their products and services across borders. The first half of the course will provide grounding for the second part of the course. 

The second half of this course will seek to address the global marketing challenges facing Asian companies, and why they must learn to become global marketing/business competitors. In particular, it seeks to provide students with some insightful perspectives on how Asian companies can begin on their journeys to become global competitors. Asian companies must learn to adapt to the fast-changing rules of global competition, when many of these rules are enacted by the West. The recent sagas against Chinese companies on toys, milk products, textiles and other related products are examples for Asian companies to realize that they cannot operate independently of international opinions, norms, and sensitivities. Without a doubt, Asian companies must continue to improve their management and learn to strategize better to effectively deal with the West. They need to improve their global competitiveness, learn to build world-class businesses and brands, and how to establish sustainable global companies in order to rival the Western multi-national corporations. There will be a couple of sessions in which you will be exposed to how Sun Zi Bingfa can be applied to global business strategies. Given the rising economic power of China, Sun Zi Bingfa can provide a useful insight into the mind of the Chinese corporate strategist.
