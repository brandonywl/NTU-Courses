Course will combine theoretical lectures about the formation of crystals and main rocks types followed by lab work where the students will learn about the optical microscope and how to identify main minerals in hand specimen and under the microscope. The students will do a project about a rock of their choice where they will have to identify main components, provide a geological background, and also ideas as why the rock in question might be important for research or society. 
During the project the student will learn how to organize information and cite literature as in scientific research papers. There is also an analytical component where the students will learn what are the main techniques to determine the composition and textures of rock and minerals, plus have hands on experience about making a thin section, taking images of the minerals with the optical microscope and obtain backscattered electron images using the scanning electron microscope.

This course introduces students to process geomorphology, sedimentology and stratigraphic principles, and provides tools for the interpretation of sediments and sedimentary rocks and basins.  Lectures in weeks 1-2 cover sediments composition, sediment transport and sedimentary structures. Lecture in week 3 introduces the facies approach to sedimentology and
geomorphology. The second phase moves to conceptualise the processes of formation, transport and deposition of sediment. During lectures in weeks 5-8 students develop conceptual models for the full range of landscapes and sedimentary environments on earth, from desert dunes to deep seas muds and coral reefs to gravel bed rivers. Lectures from weeks 8-11 introduce the concepts of sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary basin analysis. The lecture series is supplemented by 8 laboratory exercises and 2 field trips the first a half day
and the second a 4 day trip to Miri in Malaysia. The field program is a major part of the course
both in content and assessment.

Environmental issues have entered the centre of international politics and global governance in the recent two decades. This course is to introduce global environmental politics and governance (actors, institutions, mechanisms, norms and power dynamics) to students, and examine the topic by a typology of three categories: global common pool resource, transboundary environmental disputes, and local accumulative environmental change. The course encourages and mentors student?s independent research and critical thinking beyond readings and classroom discussion by assigning them into groups and conduct in-depth case studies, taking them to visit an environmental organization with global outreach and impact, and guiding them to incorporate first-hand observation into systemic learning. Via multiple learning sources and innovative teaching methods, the course aims at opening a compound, dynamic and interdisciplinary field to the students.

The class will cover concepts in both global geophysics and applied geophysics, w ith an emphasis on research done at NTU. The main goal of this class is to provide students with general understandin g of some techniques that are u sed to probe the Earth's su rface. The techniques that w ill be presented  during this class are used  in both private sectors as well as in Earth science in general.
This course will serve as an introduction to the stud y of Earth phenom ena such as gravity, earthquakes, plate movements and magnetism as well as what they tell u s about the deep Earth. In addition we will study the response of the Earth to various signals (e.g. reflection seismic, GPR, resistivity , etc.) and how we can u se this to better understand the subsurface. The class will have a theoretical part as well as complimentary tutorials where we will acquire (when possible) and process data.

Upon arrival in the field,students will participate in basic orientation exercises including detailed
safety briefings. The main field course will take place in three different areas of eastern California. 

Mapping days
On each mapping day, students will participate in a morning briefing, head into the field area to
participate in mapping projects, and work on report writing or map production in the evening.
Students will participate in camp maintenance and food preparation on a rotating group basis.

Area 1- Cerro Gordo,CA
Students will map bedrock geology of a fold-and-thrust belt. They will identify rock types and their field relationships, construct cross sections at multiple scales,and create a geological map. Students will observe faults, folds, pervasive deformation structures,sedimentary sequences,and complex igneous units.

Area 2 - Panum Crater,CA
Students will map a young rhyolitic eruptive center.They will identify different eruptive units,
! observe and interpret ductile and brittle rock fabrics,and construct a conceptual model of the evolution of Panum Crater during its life cycle.

Area 3 - Lundy Canyon, CA
Students will map surficial sediments and geomorphic features related to multiple cycles of
glaciation, Pleistocene lake levelfluctuations,delta formation,and range-front normalfaulting.
They will create a detailed geomorphic-geological map and investigate the relationships between 1 peak glaciation,lake level high stand,and long-term uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Rest days
Approximately one day per week, students will participate in a short morning field exercise and
then travel into a nearby town to wash clothes,rest, and participate in voluntary short field
excursions in the region. After spending the night in proper accommodations, they will return to the field and participate in afternoon field work.

Final field tour
The last days of the field camp will be used for regional field excursions, which will challenge the
students to integrate their field experiences into an overarching picture of the geological evolution of the East Sierra Nevada region.

Camp participation
The essential skills of independent field work include the ability to cook, clean, perform tasks that benefit the camp as needed,and maintain good work ing relationships with other camp members. Students will participate in food preparation, cooking, and dish washing on a rotating group basis.

The means by which living things put together or break down complex molecules and derive energy will be the foundation for the course. Some of these processes will be universal whilst others may be specific to plants, animals or subsets thereof. Movement, transport, and signaling will be added to the basic physiological framework.  Adaptations to variations in environment will segue into physiological ecology, which will integrate all course content in the context of nature?s laboratory ? complex ecosystems.

This course aims to support you in developing the requisite skills to interpret patterns and processes in the field, and perform successful field work. During a field trip in Taiwan, combined with follow-up activities, you will learn to assess the factors that drive the structure and functioning of ecosystems, help frame research questions, conduct field work, process the data and interpret the results, as you would do working in an Environmental Sciences field. As such it will help put principles learned in the classroom into practice. Through this project you will essentially learn the importance of project management including prioritisation, time and resources management and liaising between different people.

This seminar aims to offer students the in-depth, comprehensive knowledge and analyses of potentials, strengths, and limitations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through class discussions, students will learn history, characteristics, and functions of ASEAN from the material and ideational perspectives. With these knowledge, students will gain an ability to analyze the ASEAN?s utility (potentials and limitations) and raison d'etre by employing not only International Relations (IR) theories, but also theories in other fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, history). Those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations and Asian/Southeast Asian studies or career in foreign affairs and international relations should take this course, since this becomes a rigid intellectual foundation of ASEAN studies.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.
