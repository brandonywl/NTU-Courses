This course examines the writings on place from the 1930s onward. It explores the changing focus and meaning in the literary or cinematic rendering of different locales. While a place can be the anchor of identity, site of cultural memory and practice, and refuge for dwelling, such meanings are not given but very much the work of cultural imagination and creation. How do literature and cinema contribute to creating a sense of place and confer an identity on a place, under what circumstances and to what political and cultural effects? As the deepening environmental crises increasingly ravages our natural world, how do the writings on places document environmental  degradation? How do their otherworldly portrayals - be them industrial, postindustrial, heterotopic, dystopic, etc. - shed light on our collective reality and engage our senses and intellect to promote possible social change? These are the important questions we will discuss in this course.

This course combines a variety of texts and gender/sexuality research theories in order to discuss issues of sex and gender/sexuality in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. These include sexual attractiveness and sexual desire in pre-Qin and Qin/Han literature, lust and eroticism in Ming/Qing literature, the destruction of family and the abandonment of marriage in early modern Chinese literature, love in friendship and the construction of masculinity, Chinese feminism and female sexual desire, new sexual morality discourse and the great debate on love, the first and second waves of feminism, and queer theory. By tracing the development and changes in Chinese concepts of gender/sexuality from ancient times to the present day, this course aims to ensure that you can, while remaining rooted in history, refer to constructions of knowledge in Western gender/sexuality culture and theory and proceed to rethink and deepen the contemporary discussion on these topics on an individual and societal level.

Since the late 17th century, Taiwan has experienced the transformation from being an island frontier of the Qing Dynasty, a Japanese colony, a Chinese territory, and to a country with a full-fledged democracy today. Notably, Taiwan has been closely intertwined with China, though sometimes at odds. This lecture/discussion course will focus on the modern history of Taiwan and explore, in particular, the intertwined and potentially bellicose relationship between Taiwan and China from a historical perspective. It considers the changing relationship between these two societies as the dialectic of their transformation into nations. From an island frontier to an independent state 'in want of a nation' and international recognition, the transformation of Taiwan has been shaping and shaped by China's transformation from a dynastic empire to a nationalistic state in pursuit of territorial unification. This course will examine key events and forces (political, social, economic, and cultural) that had shaped and/or are still shaping the Taiwan-China relations.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

From the first Apple Macintosh advert (which featured the tag line `why 1984 won't be like 1984') to Wikileaks (via Neil Postman's Amusing ourselves to death), in popular cultural cameos from David Bowie's Diamond Dogs to Haruki Murakami 1Q84, 1984 seems to be everywhere. In this course you'll explore the transformations of George Orwell's touchstone novel and this broader, mobile idea. To test out these ideas and to understand the shifting cultural contexts of `1984' as a metaphorical prism, we will focus on both the real events of 1984 (when Orwell's work was purportedly to have come true) as well as anticipations of an Orwellian future from the 1970s to the present day. By weaving together art history, literature, media, politics, technology and social activism, we will bring increasingly staid debates about postmodernism, mediatisation and the Cold War (another term coined by Orwell) back to critical life. This interdisciplinary course asks you to think both as a literary critic and cultural historian in order to reevalute this overdetermined juncture of modern life.
