'The Asian Century' is the buzz word that many pundits and experts use in describing East Asia in the 21st Century. Given the rapid economic development in the region, propelled by China and the Southeast Asian states with the United States, Japan, and South Korea as the established economies, Asia has a great potential to lead the world economies. However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.'
This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism. We will discuss the concept of 'East Asia' and ?International Security; history of East Asian security; US 'hub-and-spoke' system, particularly the US-Japan alliance; ASEAN multilateralism, particularly ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and East Asia Summit; advanced theoretical frameworks to make sense of East Asian security; and regional security issues, such as the Rise of China, the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, East and South China Sea. In order to foster discussions in the class, students need to catch up with contemporary East Asian affairs, through Newspaper, Magazines, and on-line media. By the end of this class, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in East Asia and be able to use international relations theory to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to resolve them.

Qualitative research is an essential tool for deeper probing of diverse social phenomena and for
designing effective public management strategies and policies. In the public administration and
policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have
contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and
environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent
researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science
research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the
analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume
research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills
for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while
studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a
qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct
qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique. 
This course is organized along the following themes: (1) introduction of qualitative research, (2)
research proposal outline, (3) developing and designing qualitative research, (4) observation
studies, (5) interviews, (6) discourse and narrative research, (7) analysis of verbal data, (8) video
data analysis, (9) case study, (10) content analysis, and (11) mixed methods.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.

This course introduces you to the foundations of the development of cities and the role that urban planning plays in shaping the life of cities. In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning.
