This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

In its widest sense, culture refers to the sum total of ways of life that are shared by members of a society, providing a sense of social order and yet changing through time. In addition to the concept of material culture, this course focuses on intangible aspects of culture such as values, norms, ideas, beliefs and symbols, which govern the conduct of social life. Culture is transmitted by the institutions and processes of  socialization and is drawn into the social construction of personal and collective identities. The course also discusses changing conceptions of selfhood in modern society and issues related to ethnocentrism, cultural relativism, subculture, global culture, popular culture, and multiculturalism.

Rapid advancement in science and technology presents individuals and societies with a unprecedented array of challenges. This course explores the social, ethical and policy issues associated with scientific and technological advancement by posing questions such as the following: What is science? How is scientific knowledge created, disseminated and adopted? How are discoveries and inventions made and accepted? What is the nature of scientific and technological progress? How is it influenced by social, political, economic and cultural factors? What are the roles of universities, research institutes and industrial or business partners? In examining the social implications and consequences of the new scientific ideas and technological applications, the course scrutinizes developments in multiple fields, including the life sciences, medicine, engineering and digital media.

This course is designed with the aim of enabling Arts and Humanities students to carefully research and analyze texts, reflect on them, and write disciplinarily appropriate essays.  The basic premise of the course is that effective writing in the Arts and Humanities is based on excellent, informed, and interdisciplinary analysis of original texts.  Students will be exposed to a variety of primary texts from their own discipline, as well as those of other disciplines in the Arts and Humanities, and taught how to approach and analyze them.  They will furthermore be taught how to incorporate and use arguments from secondary sources, how to develop strong research questions, and how to research and put together a strong research paper. Throughout, the course emphasizes a consideration of the how other disciplines contribute to research in their own discipline.

What's proper reasoning and how do you tell whether an argument is good or bad? This class introduces you to formal logic, a set of powerful tools that allow us to give precise answers to the preceding questions. Along the way we will also discuss a few paradoxes - for example, how should we understand and evaluate claims about objects that don't exist, such as the claim that Santa Clause lives on the North Pole?

This course offers an overview of central arguments and debates in early modern philosophy. We will examine different responses to what is arguably the central epistemological question of the period: is knowledge based on reason or on experience? By working through the answers to this question given by Descartes, Hume, Leibniz, and Kant, we will better understand key commitments of the Rationalist and Empiricist philosophical traditions, and get a sense of how Kant attempts to transform the terms of the debate. We will also have the opportunity to cultivate analytical and critical skills that will help us better understand the arguments of early-modern philosophers and their relevance today. The course will feature extensive textual and argument analysis.

'Friendship' introduces the nature of friendship through different historical thinkers as well as contemporary theories. The course challenges students to think about the necessary components of a friendship and the importance of friendship in becoming an ethical person. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop highlevel critical thinking and writing skills by examining historical text and contemporary writing. Students will bechallenged to think about ?friendship? as a philosophical issue but draw practical significance from studying it.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

This course offers an introduction to and overview of some of the most important philosophical currents of European philosophy in the 20th century. Its goal will be to help students understand the key claims, strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions of central areas of European thought, especially phenomenology, existentialism, critical theory, structuralism, continental feminism, psychoanalysis, hermeneutics, and deconstruction.

Through a combination of close reading and textual analysis, we will study how thinkers from different currents in European philosophy attempt to resolve the problems they think plague their predecessors, and how they propose to move beyond them.

Some topics and questions to be explored include the relation between perception, thought, and language; the philosophical importance of history; the limits of human reason and knowledge; what embodiment can tell us about experience; the role of ideology and power in the formation of human knowledge, etc.

This course is designed to introduce students to a range of philosophical issues surrounding race and gender.  There are two main topics that we?ll be exploring in the course, each of which will occupy about half of the term.  The first topic is the multidisciplinary debate about what race and gender actually are, which we will engage with through critical examination of a range of proposed definitions of race and gender.  The second topic is the social, ethical, and political significance that race and gender, with particular attention to the ways that race and gender shape the opportunities and obstacles faced by individuals/groups in society.  By examining these issues, students will gain a better understanding of the role of race and gender in their own individual identity as well as the ability to think critically about societal policies and ideologies related to race and gender.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

This is a class on metaphysics, epistemology, and the intersection between these two fields. Our main focus will be on us and our status in the world (both epistemologically and metaphysically), and we will be interested in questions such as the following ones: What is knowledge and how can we know anything about the external world? How should we respond when we find that our
peers disagree with us? Is our knowledge of ourselves qualitatively different from our knowledge of others? What are we anyway?
