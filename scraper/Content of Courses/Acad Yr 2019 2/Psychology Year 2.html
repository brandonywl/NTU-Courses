The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

Designed for students interested in the scientific study of behavior, this course presents an integrative approach to studying the mechanisms and function of animal behavior. It also provides you with a basis for understanding how research on behavior is conducted, and how studies of animals contribute to behavioral science. You will learn about the integrative approach to studying behavior, exploring the contributions that development, genetics, neurology, and physiology have on behavior. You will cover approaches examining the evolutionary function of behavior, and will be exposed to studies on animal communication and sociality. You will also learn the relevance of animal studies in better clarifying the mechanisms of human behavior.

This course is about the study of transactions between individuals and their physical settings. In these transactions, individuals change the environment, and their behavior and experiences are changed by the environment. Environmental psychology includes theory, research, and practice aimed at improving your relationship with the natural environment. Proper understanding of the interaction between mind and natural environment is crucial for those of you who desire to work not only at environmental agencies but also at engineering, city planning, or policymaking. 

The goal of this course is to provide the foundations to understand environmental psychology ? the understanding of person-environment transactions and the application of that understanding to solve real-world problems that most or even all people face. To achieve this goal, you will be exposed to a thorough understanding of the internal characteristics that filter or digest external factors. Working in an area that is so critical to almost every human activity brings a high degree of excitement and a justifiable sense of importance.

This course provides an introduction to psychological perspectives on criminal and antisocial
behavior. It will also incorporate knowledge from interdisciplinary areas to examine the interplay
between psychological,social, and biological factors in predisposing to crime and violence. Different developmental trajectories and forms of crime and criminals will be discussed.
Throughout the course, we will also attempt to bridge the basic science of criminal behavior with the real world through case studies and discussion of the implications of psychological and criminological research for the criminal justice system. The content of this course deals with the
developmental, neuroscience, clinical, social, and cognitive subdivisions of psychology.
