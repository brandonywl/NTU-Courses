This course will cover the use of GIS to explore earth systems science. The course will start by
introducing basic skills and workflows. The students will then define and complete two independent projects, related to various earth systems science topics (water flow, earthquakes, volcanoes, flooding, meteorite impacts, land use, etc.). Students will be expected to have basic scientific knowledge about the Earth from ES1003. Students turn in a written report for their first project, illustrated using images from GIS. Students will present the results of their second project in class.

This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students who have never been exposed to political science studies to the fundamentals of the discipline. In so doing, students in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme (major & minor) will acquire the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical tools that would allow them to think seriously about politics. The ultimate goal is to equip students with essential political ideas and principles and enable them to apply these concepts to studying contemporary political life.

Since the early 1990s, the Internet has been viewed as an increasingly essential tool to improve public sector performance, stimulate economic growth and facilitate better governance. Many governments worldwide have invested heavily in e-government implementation in order to realize the transformative potential of e-government. In the context of a changing world, the challenges facing governments have increased. Governments are under mounting pressure to strengthen their governing capacities and foster future growth and stability. In an era of crisis and uncertainty, the study of e-government has become more necessary and important than ever before. 

The aims of this course are to enable students to gain both theoretical and empirical knowledge of e-government, and to equip students with critical thinking and problem solving skills to examine key issues in e-government.

This is an introductory course to the research methods and basic statistical techniques commonly used in psychology research. Students will be introduced to the process of scientific inquiry in psychology, both in terms of empirical research methodology and statistical analysis. The course is divided into lectures and tutorials. The lectures will focus on conceptual issues and cover the content materials that students need to understand to actually design any psychological study and work with any data. The tutorials will be dedicated to more in-depth discussions of some of the topics covered in the lectures, and practical experience with data analysis using SPSS
