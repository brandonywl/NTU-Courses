Exhibition design or narrative environments?
Exhibition environments can be enlightening, immersive, interactive, and use all kinds of media: video projections, historical objects, specimens, hands-on exhibits, innovative technologies. In this course you will explore how exhibition design is evolving, to become more engaging, participatory and more effective. You will critique the role design can play in the communication of objects, ideas and information within the exhibition environment, and how the different elements of a display effectively blend.
The course presents an overview of the key characteristics of exhibition design, definitions and use of terms, and an introduction to different types of exhibitions: permanent, temporary, travelling.

Historical overview
Looking at the evolution of exhibition design over time. Focusing on key transformations underpinning museography, the model of Universal Expositions and the development of new aesthetics through the experiments of the avant-garde movements.

Field trips to Museums and Art Galleries
Exploration of the exhibition space and articulation of the visitor experience. Analysing the elements that compose an exhibition. Through analysis of a variety of examples from museums and art exhibitions, you will learn about the role of spatial perception, navigation, object placement, graphics, media and lighting in the exhibition contexts.

Working behind an exhibition
In-depth exploration of strategies to create a display and an exhibition with a larger narrative. Through analysis of a variety of case studies, you will learn about the teams that work behind exhibitions. The concept of structuring content by layering text, graphics and media. Basic applications of graphic design, typographic standards and the integration of narrative media are explored as elements of the exhibition making process.
Presentation and discussion of various issues related to exhibition making with a particular focus on strategies of audience engagement, interpretative techniques, functionality, aesthetic and sustainability helping you to experiment and reflect on the relationship between collections, content and visitors? experience.

Essay reading, writing and discussion
These classes are dedicated to the critical discussion of issues related to exhibition making today in the context of Museums and Art Galleries. Reading, writing and discussion may include reflections on newly emerging exhibition-formats that deviate from traditional displays. It provides a basic introduction and familiarizes students with new terms and challenges in conceiving innovative exhibitions.

Class assignments
Two creative projects explore the synergies between narrative and space in exhibition.
The first consist in the creation of a display using objects to tell a story. 
-	Investigation on objects as an element of storytelling;
-	Function of the single object in the display;
-	Basic concepts of arrangement, composition, lighting and colour within a display;
-	Introduction of textual or media elements.
The second project is the creation of an exhibition for a medium size gallery. An investigation on conceptualizing, planning and representing an exhibition. 
-	Concept, storyline, zones and displays in relation to the visitor experience; 
-	Exhibition layout and circulation;
-	Collection arrangement;
-	Content layering through the introduction of textual or media elements;
-	Exhibition visualization (3D Modeling)
Both assignments are developed through lectures, tutorials, class teamwork and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in Art History and Theory. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their relevance to Art History and Theory in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire key critical skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and new insights.
Finally, you will present your responses, in the form of a written paper and oral presentations.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the questions and issues it provokes. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Paper.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.

Following the course DD3005 Survey of Modern Art, 1900-1945, which ends in 1945, the course DD3013 From Modern to Post-Modern Art 1945-1985 completes the full chronology of Art History from the introductory modules that explore the ancient and the classical, right through to modern, post-modern and contemporary forms. The course examines a period of forty years of European and American art history that laid the foundations for today's art.  It encompasses post-World War II High-Modernism, 1960s and 1970s Anti-Modernism, and 1980s Postmodernism. Broadly chronological in approach, the course begins with an in-depth study of the different forms of Abstract Art in the post-war period, before embarking into a survey across some of the most important artistic movements in the 20th century. It includes Art Brut and Outsider Art, Nouveau Realisme, Pop Art and Photorealism, Op and Kinetic Art, Fluxus and Performance Art, Conceptual Art, Minimalism, Arte Povera, Environmental and Land Art, Neo-Historicism and Graffiti Art. 

New approaches to art making, and critical frameworks used to discuss and interpret modern art will also be considered in relation to the historical contexts in which they were produced, including, but not limited to: the politics of the Cold War period; the rise of consumerism in the 1950s; the civil rights movement and institutional critiques of the 1960s; the, the growth and influence of feminism in the1970s and the crisis of representation and meta-narratives in the1980s.

This introductory course covers key movements and events in the evolution of Interaction Design, Product Design and Visual Communication. In Interaction Design, you will survey the work and ideas of artists and designers who have explored interactive media, as well as the scientists, engineers and mathematicians who have developed information technologies. You will study the histories of certain technologies which have come to define the medium of personal computer and human-computer interaction. For Product Design, you will explore how design trends and movements are formed in the contexts of history, emphasizing human relationships between designed objects, visual imageries, art & design movements, science, technology, culture and society. In Visual Communication, you will gain a historical awareness of graphic design and its relationship to technology and industry practice. You will analyse design and designers from various eras through practice and theoretical research projects. This course will equip you with a solid foundation in design history and theory, and inform further study in contemporary design practice.


Course Introduction and overview

At the introduction to this course you will be introduced to an overview of how Interaction, Product, and Visual Communication each contribute to the history of design.

You will then attend three sections where you will study each of these areas in 4-week blocks.

Interaction Design
In History of Interaction in Design you will explore the key principles of interaction. Firstly, the reciprocal exchange between the viewer and the artwork with the ability to manipulate media and objects intuitively. Secondly, The non-sequential linking of information, events, and discrete media. And thirdly, the experience of entering a multi-sensory representation of three-dimensional space. These three themes will be referred to as Interactivity, Hypermedia, and Immersion.

?	Interactivity: This topic explores the evolution of the graphical user interface and the technical, aesthetic, and cognitive concepts behind human-computer interactions, and their influence on the art, design and application of interactive media. 
?	Hypermedia: A discussion of the evolution of hypermedia and the non-linear association of information resulting in the changing spatial and temporal boundaries in interactive media design.
?	Immersion: An exploration of the evolution of virtual reality and 3D virtual space: multimedia as an immersive experience that engages multiple senses.  
 
Product Design
In History of Product Design you will explore how objects and the built environment are produced in response to changes in thinking and ideas. These ideas evolve according to human values, contexts and conditions. Rationales and qualities of objects change, with new relationships being formed with individuals, societies and ecology, over the flow of the significant timelines: 

?	The Industrial revolution
?	Design Reform Movements in Europe and America
?	Modernism & Post Modernism across the Atlantic
?	The Conceptual in Art & Design
?	Discursive & Immaterial Frontiers

Visual Communication
In Visual Communication you will focus chiefly on the history and development of graphic design. This course facilitates you in locating, critically evaluating and presenting a variety of historical information from a variety of sources. Through an active learning strategy this course intends to engage you with design?s vast visual library and its social, political and technological contexts in order to underpin creative practice. Contemporary designers take inspiration from many sources and exploring graphic design?s past is one proven method of expanding visual vocabulary. The course will provide a concise overview of Graphic Design history focusing on the following periods:

?	The Visual Word
?	The Industrial Revolution
?	The Modernist Era
?	The Age of Information
 
 
Student Presentations
In each section, Interaction, Product, and Visual Communication, you will deliver a 10 minute group presentation supported by a handout.

This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

Through weekly slide lecture presentations by the professor, assigned weekly readings, quizzes, and group presentations, you will learn about various photo inventions, movements, and works in relation to diverse socio-historical-art contexts. 

By studying the past, you will learn to use history to  inspire and understand new ways of seeing and visualizing the future in your chosen medium or academic pursuit.

All assignments and images will be  posted to the class OSS web page.

In the first part of the course you will look at the developments of the medium up to the modern era. Beginning with the first description of the `elusive image? in antiquity and the first discoveries in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, illustrated lectures will trace the parallel development of artistic, commercial, scientific and social applications of photography. Attention will be paid to the relationship of creativity to technical innovation, especially in the early years in Europe and the US when photographers functioned simultaneously as artists, inventors and scientists. In addition, as the ongoing pendulum swings between documentary ?truth telling? methods and artistic pictorial, conceptual concerns will be examined.These directions wil be traced as well to South East ASIA.
In the second part of the course you will be directed towards the different schools of photography, which from the beginning of the twentieth century started to be clearly defined, from documentary to pictorial to commercial. Closer examination of works by individual photographers will be viewed in tandem with theoretical issues that have emerged in recent scholarship and debates.
Review and Enhancement: Each class begins a group presentation presenting 3 topics researched in more detail from the previous class lecture

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.
