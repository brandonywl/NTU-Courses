This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

The overarching theme of this new century is the rapid rate of change on the planet and its hastening effect on climate change. The challenge is to learn to collaborate and develop cross-disciplinary partnerships as well as new skills to engage with these complex problems.

How can art open minds and hearts in order to act? How can scientists use research in a compelling and approachable matter for all to be concerned? How can artists learn to use scientific research for creative outcomes? How can scientists be artists and artists be scientists? This is the challenge of this course. 

Renowned artist/scientists who focus on ecological issues will be discussed. Field trips will include visits to areas concerned with ecological restoration and preservation e.g. waste and water remediation sites, wetlands, gardens, and nature preserves. Students will be required to read, research, and explore media and studio techniques beyond their known disciplines. Art studio as well library research time is required. 

The first meeting will outline ecological issues and cutting-edge research; the second meeting will discuss ecologically focused artists? work and critical responses.  Simple studio practices including drawing and other design tools, collage, and photography will be introduced guided by ADM students and faculty. Key readings and scientific practices will be guided by ASE students and faculty. This course addresses two of NTU?s main concerns: Sustainable Earth and Interdisciplinary Practice.

You will begin this course with an overview of the terms and contexts you will use. The first weeks cover a range of ecological topics, and how art and science work together to examine, critique, raise awareness and explore solutions.

From week 4 you will experience a more closely focused examination of ecology, loosely grouped under 5 elements: earth, air, fire, water, and energy sources. You will also be conducting research, written and visual, and forming a research topic portfolio.

From week 8 collaboration between artists and scientists begins. You will examine at a range of examples as a range of collaboration methods are discussed.

Throughout the entire course, you, in collaboration with others, will be gradually forming a project. In weeks 11 to 13, the focus intensifies to the resolution of this project, with a final 15-minute presentation in week 13.

This course is a practical course that focuses on learning techniques and processes to create digital 3d models. There are two main types of digital modelling ? constructed and sculpted. Both approaches will be learned and explored as to their suitability for a range of outcomes. A wide range of mechanical and organic shapes will be developed, using a variety of techniques and level of detail. Surface colouring and lighting will be examined, as well as other surface attributes such as reflectivity, shininess, dullness, glow, wetness, as well as some discussion into complex surface textures such as hair.

The course will also cover a range of export and linking options in order to integrate into  a production scenario for animation, special effects, cinema or digital gaming.

The act of eating encompasses many aspects of biology. From the stimulation of sensory organs during tasting, digestion, to nutritional absorption and homeostasis that follow, each stage of these biological processes has significant influence on the consumers? perception of ?eating experience?. Furthermore, conditions such as food allergy have specific physiological consequences that warrant attention and consideration. At the other end of the spectrum, both the biology of living things serving as food material and the methods of food preparation has impacts on the tastes of food. These factors will be considered holistically through projects addressing various themes.

Practical Ethics' is a course for students who want to make sense of the idea of right and wrong in a commonsense and practical way that relates to the world we live in (especially in the business context) that is informed by a firm introduction to the main ideas of some of the most important ethical theories.

The first half of the course is an introduction to the elements of ethical reasoning and the main branches of ethical theories and some of their chief modern proponents.  This lays the groundwork for the second half: which will critically apply these concepts thus examined to a consideration of the role of law and ethics in some of the paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  These may include:  corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and child labour (people), international business and public corruption, and environmental sustainability (planet). The seminars will be structured around problems (hypothethical and real) and possibly a few video clips for discussions which are intended to be interesting and engaging whilst providing the context for a serious inquiry into the issues.  Leaders of all kinds, especially those of businesses, are expected in today?s world to be sensitive to ethical dimensions of our reality. This course aims to provide the foundation for such ethical understanding and thinking.

The assessment will be based entirely on coursework: participation, presentation, and a written assignment. There are no prerequisites for the course.

NOTE: "Prospective students should take note that this is a participation intensive course intended for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. Students not prepared to undertake this are not expected to do well.?

Tourism occupies an important place in society and this course deals with the many roles it plays and purposes served. Following accounts of its current and past stages of development, the psychological and social significance of tourism are explored. Its various meanings are discussed, including within the context of religion and food. Socio-cultural impacts of tourist activity are assessed and the use of culture as a tourist attraction is reviewed which includes consideration of the relationship between history, heritage and tourism. Tourism's interactions with the environment and its contribution to sustainable development are another topic, as is the politics of tourism which extends to matters of terrorism and its effects. 

Finally, the attributes of tourism as a business and questions of destination marketing are addressed before debate about future scenarios. While illustrations are drawn from Singapore and the region, discussions will range more widely and encompass cases from around the world.

The health, beauty, and wellness industry is predicted to have a strong growth in the coming years. With the disposable income and life expectancy increasing, many consumers are willing to spend considerable amount of income on seeking and keeping health and beauty. Healthy lifestyle has become a global trend with many health conscious followers. With the growing ageing population around the world, high quality healthcare services that provides patients a pleasant experience are in great demand. This course will provide an overview of conducting marketing in three sectors of the growing health industry: 1. Consumer health and beauty products/services (e.g. healthy foods, gym membership, sports apparel, slimming treatment services); 2. Healthcare services (e.g. services in hospitals, clinics, senior-living communities, pharmacies); and 3. Health and wellness tourism (e.g. travel for medical exam, medical spa, spiritual experiences, mind-body connection). The business environment of these sectors will be reviewed. Current trends, opportunities and challenges will be highlighted to help students learn and practice how to develop marketing strategy in these sectors. On the other hand, students as consumers will gain insights into their own pursuit of health, beauty, and wellness with a deeper understanding of the business landscapes of these sectors. Fundamental marketing concepts, principles, and frameworks will be reviewed to ensure that non-business students are also equipped with necessary marketing knowledge to work on the course assignments and projects.

We live in a global world, where a premium is placed on the ability to navigate and adapt to differences. Cultural intelligence, CQ is the capability to function effectively across national, ethnic and organizational, organizational cultures (Ang & Van Dyne). IQ and EQ are no longer enough, CQ is becoming a critical predictor for success in the borderless world of the 21st century. The good news is that CQ can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. This course will focus on providing students a conceptual framework for CQ, as well as a set of tools to navigate and explore the world.

At the end of the course, students can expect the following outcomes:-
(1)	A greater understanding of their own motivation, culture, values, and personality, as well
         as their CQ strengths and weaknesses (CQ Motivation & Strategy) 

(2)	Knowledge and experience of how cultures differ in values and behaviours, and how to
         capitalize on similarities, and leverage on the differences (CQ Knowledge);
 
(3)	Enhanced awareness and efficacy of your own communication style in cross cultural
         contexts (CQ Behaviour)

Teaching Method: 

Highly experiential and focused on learning from own self-reflection, class activities and group work, this course focuses on bringing conceptual knowledge to life.

1. What is the course trying to achieve? (Purpose)
Using theories and evidence based on psychology, behavioral economics and decision
neuroscience, this course aims to help you understand the decision making processes and
especially the typical errors and biases that influence choice behavior. Armed with this
knowledge , you will be able to (i) understand and improve your own decision making abilities, (ii) understand the decision making of other stakeholders such as consumers, policy makers, patients, managers and (ii) improve and design services, strategies and policies that influence your target audiences.
2. Why should someone take this course e.g. future career, future course, etc.? (Value)
The first reason is to understand the decision making processes of various stakeholders ?
consumers, entrepreneurs, managers, public, accountants. The second reason is to help you
improve your own decision making abilities ? one of the most critical skills for the future
managers, professionals, doctors, and accountants. Finally, different companies and organizations have established behavioral units that employ the principles taught in this course to improve their services and functions. Both companies as well as governmental organizations have been actively adopting the principles of Behavioral Decision Science. This shows the importance of understanding human behavior in the design of services, strategies and policies.

This course will provide an overview of the science fiction film genre from its beginnings up to the present day.  While the majority of film examples will be drawn from the US, the course will also work to take a global perspective, offering several screenings of films from outside of the US.  Students will be introduced to basic concepts in genre theory, as well as familiarized with key themes and narrative and aesthetic trends in the science fiction film genre across its history.  Particular emphases of the course will include 1) the on-going significance of Cold War themes to the genre; 2) the genre's representations of science, technology, and scientists; and 3) the films' implicit positions on the ethical and moral issues that may arise in scientific research.

This course examines the ways in which madness is interpreted in selected literature and films from late 19th century onwards. Is madness a matter of perspective, biological disorder, subversion or metaphor? We examine four possible categories: the mentally ill with self-awareness of their debilitating condition; alienated individuals deviating from societal norms; mentally unsound individuals labeled insane by experts; and individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder in enacting transgressive acts. Using close reading of literary and visual narratives, this course will discuss madness in the contexts of self-awareness, creativity, alienation and isolation, language as construct, women and representation, the institution, sexual dysfunction and violence.

This course examines the ways in which utopian thought and absolute control can be manifested in societies. While most would reject any society that forces them to give up free will though pain and torture, how would one react to one that promises you a life of pleasure, peace and absence from fear in exchange for absolute compliance? Using close reading of literary, graphic novel, musical and visual narratives, this course will discuss the construction of control and power through the varied visions of utopias and dystopias in the contexts of individuality, culture, family, law, justice, the self in the context of a community, role of women, impact of science, freedom of thought and expression.

This course aims to teach you to think logically and critically. It covers a broad range of logical concepts and terminology, including argument, premise, conclusion, inductive and deductive reasoning, validity, soundness, and strength. You will learn how to evaluate good deductive arguments through the study of categorical and truth functional logic, and good inductive arguments using a probabilistic framework.
Finally, you will learn about common fallacies (rhetorical, statistical, and psychological), how to avoid them, and how to clearly communicate where fallacious arguments go wrong.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

Are you OK? We often ask each other this question. We are often concerned about the psychological well-being of our family members, friends, and, most importantly ourselves. In this course, we will discuss issues concerning psychological well-being and mental health in Singapore: the early signs of not being "OK", when you might need professional help, and where you might find the appropriate help. The course will be taught by a seasoned mental health practitioner in Singapore, in collaboration with our in-house faculty members.

In today's fast-paced and competitive work environment, a student is often lost as to how and where to find jobs and how to manage one's career. This course will provide an introduction to the contemporary human resource management functions: employment, employee relations, training and development, performance systems, compensation, benefits, and human resource information systems. It is not the objective of this course to train students to be HRM managers, but to provide basic information for students to plan and manage their own careers.

Today, we are living in an interconnected and culturally diverse world. This subject analyzes what happens when different cultures meet and how cultures are 'socially constructed'. Cultures are not monolithic constructs. People continuously negotiate cultural content in relation to a wide variety of factors. Globalization has accelerated and broadened various forms of cultural negotiation. The principal themes of this subject include: cultural capital, dominant cultures, sub-cultures, colonialism, Westernization, consumption, hybridity, popular culture and translocal culture.
