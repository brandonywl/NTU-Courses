The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.

You will be introduced to diverse examples of early twentieth-century visual material, and the socio-political and historical contexts in which they were produced. Broadly chronological in approach, a number of historical movements (including, but not limited to, Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada and Surrealism) will be explored alongside the work of individual artists. The influence of modernist thought and aesthetics upon different areas of artistic production will also be highlighted, as will the relationship between art and politics. 

Coursework assignments will include a class presentation of research, a paper written after a museum fieldtrip and two in-class quizzes.

This course explores European visual culture created in response to contact and interaction with non-Western cultures from the fifteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Various European representations of the exotic Orient (Near and Far East) will be examined. The influence of European Imperialism upon the fine arts will be analysed in relation to eighteenth-century colonial landscape painting, the Romantic Orientalism of Eugene Delacroix, the work of Jean-Auguste Dominque Ingres and Jean-Leon Gerome, the popularization of the East in terms of Chinoiserie and Japonisme, primitivism in the work of Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso, and the odalisques of Matisse. The course will also look at the rise of ethnography and the ethnographic museum, and the role of photography and international exhibitions.

Following the course DD3005 Survey of Modern Art, 1900-1945, which ends in 1945, the course DD3013 From Modern to Post-Modern Art 1945-1985 completes the full chronology of Art History from the introductory modules that explore the ancient and the classical, right through to modern, post-modern and contemporary forms. The course examines a period of forty years of European and American art history that laid the foundations for today's art.  It encompasses post-World War II High-Modernism, 1960s and 1970s Anti-Modernism, and 1980s Postmodernism. Broadly chronological in approach, the course begins with an in-depth study of the different forms of Abstract Art in the post-war period, before embarking into a survey across some of the most important artistic movements in the 20th century. It includes Art Brut and Outsider Art, Nouveau Realisme, Pop Art and Photorealism, Op and Kinetic Art, Fluxus and Performance Art, Conceptual Art, Minimalism, Arte Povera, Environmental and Land Art, Neo-Historicism and Graffiti Art. 

New approaches to art making, and critical frameworks used to discuss and interpret modern art will also be considered in relation to the historical contexts in which they were produced, including, but not limited to: the politics of the Cold War period; the rise of consumerism in the 1950s; the civil rights movement and institutional critiques of the 1960s; the, the growth and influence of feminism in the1970s and the crisis of representation and meta-narratives in the1980s.

This course encourages students to identify potential areas where new technologies can offer solutions to user needs. It seeks to develop in the student an understanding of how by identifying user needs and applying the principles of ergonomics, new products can be designed. In order to ascertain how people actually use products the students will do hands-on research by observing potential users, conducting user surveys and analyzing the results. From this data the students will develop and refine their product design ideas. The students are encouraged to look at emerging technologies that could be incorporated into their design solutions. The course culminates in a project where students learn to ideate, design, develop using 3D CAD techniques and create non-working prototypes (dummy models) that meets the needs and fit the ergonomic requirements of the user. In doing so the incorporation of emerging technologies in an appropriate and innovative manner is also addressed.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.
