Working from observation
In this course you will consistently work from observation in order to hone your eye and become more sensitive to the dimensional world around you. You will learn to perceive proportion both intuitively and also through measuring. You will explore concepts of composition, line work, shape design, value structure, and colour, in order to translate your ideas and perceptions into a finished drawing or sequence.

Investigating and experimenting with materials
You will be continually compelled to challenge yourself with new techniques and materials. From pen and ink, to charcoal to watercolour, this course will serve as an introduction to many new materials and processes

Finding personal aesthetic
You will continually work toward developing your pictorial goals. You will be asked to first define your specific aesthetic goals including composition, line work, lighting effects etc., and then chart a course for improving towards those goals

Integrating sketching into a creative workflow
In this class you will be encouraged to make free standing drawings that function as independent art pieces, and also to utilise drawing as a primary step in ideation.  By utilising observational as well as reference drawing, you will develop a process by which to create well informed and well observed drawings.

The course is conducted in a studio/classroom or at a site-specific place corresponding to the assignment. The instructor and students observe the progress of everyone's work, and contribute critique as it is being made. Learning is a collective experience in the classroom, and you will problem-solve on the canvas, benefitting from a cross-pollination of ideas and input from your peers. It is therefore very important that you attend all classes. 

The semester begins with representational painting using slow-drying, indirect oil painting techniques learning basic paint mixing, colour observation and composition. Gradually you will become more independent with your work. The semester ends with experimentation of modernist direct application of wet-in-wet acrylic paint. 

The course also offers opportunities to collaborate with local museum exhibitions as well as international students, artists and communities.

Exhibition design or narrative environments?
Exhibition environments can be enlightening, immersive, interactive, and use all kinds of media: video projections, historical objects, specimens, hands-on exhibits, innovative technologies. In this course you will explore how exhibition design is evolving, to become more engaging, participatory and more effective. You will critique the role design can play in the communication of objects, ideas and information within the exhibition environment, and how the different elements of a display effectively blend.
The course presents an overview of the key characteristics of exhibition design, definitions and use of terms, and an introduction to different types of exhibitions: permanent, temporary, travelling.

Historical overview
Looking at the evolution of exhibition design over time. Focusing on key transformations underpinning museography, the model of Universal Expositions and the development of new aesthetics through the experiments of the avant-garde movements.

Field trips to Museums and Art Galleries
Exploration of the exhibition space and articulation of the visitor experience. Analysing the elements that compose an exhibition. Through analysis of a variety of examples from museums and art exhibitions, you will learn about the role of spatial perception, navigation, object placement, graphics, media and lighting in the exhibition contexts.

Working behind an exhibition
In-depth exploration of strategies to create a display and an exhibition with a larger narrative. Through analysis of a variety of case studies, you will learn about the teams that work behind exhibitions. The concept of structuring content by layering text, graphics and media. Basic applications of graphic design, typographic standards and the integration of narrative media are explored as elements of the exhibition making process.
Presentation and discussion of various issues related to exhibition making with a particular focus on strategies of audience engagement, interpretative techniques, functionality, aesthetic and sustainability helping you to experiment and reflect on the relationship between collections, content and visitors? experience.

Essay reading, writing and discussion
These classes are dedicated to the critical discussion of issues related to exhibition making today in the context of Museums and Art Galleries. Reading, writing and discussion may include reflections on newly emerging exhibition-formats that deviate from traditional displays. It provides a basic introduction and familiarizes students with new terms and challenges in conceiving innovative exhibitions.

Class assignments
Two creative projects explore the synergies between narrative and space in exhibition.
The first consist in the creation of a display using objects to tell a story. 
-	Investigation on objects as an element of storytelling;
-	Function of the single object in the display;
-	Basic concepts of arrangement, composition, lighting and colour within a display;
-	Introduction of textual or media elements.
The second project is the creation of an exhibition for a medium size gallery. An investigation on conceptualizing, planning and representing an exhibition. 
-	Concept, storyline, zones and displays in relation to the visitor experience; 
-	Exhibition layout and circulation;
-	Collection arrangement;
-	Content layering through the introduction of textual or media elements;
-	Exhibition visualization (3D Modeling)
Both assignments are developed through lectures, tutorials, class teamwork and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in Art History and Theory. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their relevance to Art History and Theory in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire key critical skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and new insights.
Finally, you will present your responses, in the form of a written paper and oral presentations.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the questions and issues it provokes. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Paper.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.
   
Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

You will be introduced to diverse examples of early twentieth-century visual material, and the socio-political and historical contexts in which they were produced. Broadly chronological in approach, a number of historical movements (including, but not limited to, Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada and Surrealism) will be explored alongside the work of individual artists. The influence of modernist thought and aesthetics upon different areas of artistic production will also be highlighted, as will the relationship between art and politics. 

Coursework assignments will include a class presentation of research, a paper written after a museum fieldtrip and two in-class quizzes.

Following the course DD3005 Survey of Modern Art, 1900-1945, which ends in 1945, the course DD3013 From Modern to Post-Modern Art 1945-1985 completes the full chronology of Art History from the introductory modules that explore the ancient and the classical, right through to modern, post-modern and contemporary forms. The course examines a period of forty years of European and American art history that laid the foundations for today's art.  It encompasses post-World War II High-Modernism, 1960s and 1970s Anti-Modernism, and 1980s Postmodernism. Broadly chronological in approach, the course begins with an in-depth study of the different forms of Abstract Art in the post-war period, before embarking into a survey across some of the most important artistic movements in the 20th century. It includes Art Brut and Outsider Art, Nouveau Realisme, Pop Art and Photorealism, Op and Kinetic Art, Fluxus and Performance Art, Conceptual Art, Minimalism, Arte Povera, Environmental and Land Art, Neo-Historicism and Graffiti Art. 

New approaches to art making, and critical frameworks used to discuss and interpret modern art will also be considered in relation to the historical contexts in which they were produced, including, but not limited to: the politics of the Cold War period; the rise of consumerism in the 1950s; the civil rights movement and institutional critiques of the 1960s; the, the growth and influence of feminism in the1970s and the crisis of representation and meta-narratives in the1980s.

This introductory course covers key movements and events in the evolution of Interaction Design, Product Design and Visual Communication. In Interaction Design, you will survey the work and ideas of artists and designers who have explored interactive media, as well as the scientists, engineers and mathematicians who have developed information technologies. You will study the histories of certain technologies which have come to define the medium of personal computer and human-computer interaction. For Product Design, you will explore how design trends and movements are formed in the contexts of history, emphasizing human relationships between designed objects, visual imageries, art & design movements, science, technology, culture and society. In Visual Communication, you will gain a historical awareness of graphic design and its relationship to technology and industry practice. You will analyse design and designers from various eras through practice and theoretical research projects. This course will equip you with a solid foundation in design history and theory, and inform further study in contemporary design practice.


Course Introduction and overview

At the introduction to this course you will be introduced to an overview of how Interaction, Product, and Visual Communication each contribute to the history of design.

You will then attend three sections where you will study each of these areas in 4-week blocks.

Interaction Design
In History of Interaction in Design you will explore the key principles of interaction. Firstly, the reciprocal exchange between the viewer and the artwork with the ability to manipulate media and objects intuitively. Secondly, The non-sequential linking of information, events, and discrete media. And thirdly, the experience of entering a multi-sensory representation of three-dimensional space. These three themes will be referred to as Interactivity, Hypermedia, and Immersion.

?	Interactivity: This topic explores the evolution of the graphical user interface and the technical, aesthetic, and cognitive concepts behind human-computer interactions, and their influence on the art, design and application of interactive media. 
?	Hypermedia: A discussion of the evolution of hypermedia and the non-linear association of information resulting in the changing spatial and temporal boundaries in interactive media design.
?	Immersion: An exploration of the evolution of virtual reality and 3D virtual space: multimedia as an immersive experience that engages multiple senses.  
 
Product Design
In History of Product Design you will explore how objects and the built environment are produced in response to changes in thinking and ideas. These ideas evolve according to human values, contexts and conditions. Rationales and qualities of objects change, with new relationships being formed with individuals, societies and ecology, over the flow of the significant timelines: 

?	The Industrial revolution
?	Design Reform Movements in Europe and America
?	Modernism & Post Modernism across the Atlantic
?	The Conceptual in Art & Design
?	Discursive & Immaterial Frontiers

Visual Communication
In Visual Communication you will focus chiefly on the history and development of graphic design. This course facilitates you in locating, critically evaluating and presenting a variety of historical information from a variety of sources. Through an active learning strategy this course intends to engage you with design?s vast visual library and its social, political and technological contexts in order to underpin creative practice. Contemporary designers take inspiration from many sources and exploring graphic design?s past is one proven method of expanding visual vocabulary. The course will provide a concise overview of Graphic Design history focusing on the following periods:

?	The Visual Word
?	The Industrial Revolution
?	The Modernist Era
?	The Age of Information
 
 
Student Presentations
In each section, Interaction, Product, and Visual Communication, you will deliver a 10 minute group presentation supported by a handout.

As we witness the trend in merging of fields of expertise and medias, design thinking has become a common denominator, driver, translator, and connector of different disciplines.

This course encourages a mix of unusual types of collaborations among disciplines. You will get a taste of the design thinking process comprising of: empathy, definition of problem, ideation, prototyping and testing.
 
Lectures will introduce you to the key phases of design thinking. 

1.	Empathy: understand the user needs through empathy employing different methods of observation, engagement and immersion

2.	Definition of problem: capture and analyze the findings of observation in order to create a point of view

3.	Ideation: generation of unusual, radical responses to address points of view

4.	Prototyping: physical exploration through construction of objects, role play, story boarding to investigate how ideas develop and take place in the physical space

5.	Testing: generate feedback from users, incorporate feedback into prototype, continue to learn about the user?s needs.

Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in film practice. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their immediate relevance to film practice in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire any necessary skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and possible solution.

Finally, you will present your response, describing your analysis, strategy, process, which will move toward your proposed film project.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the response. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Project Presentation and handin.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

This studio course provides an introduction to the techniques and processes of recording production sound with a focus on dialog for fiction and documentary film. The physics of sound and hearing will be examined in the context of the aesthetics of sound for images. Microphone types, functions and best practices for their use will be examined. Single and dual system audio recording techniques will be demonstrated. Students will learn how to prepare production audio for postproduction editing. An introduction to post production will include transfer formats from NLEs to Pro Tools and an introduction to dialog editing. This learning will form the basis for students to refine their use of sound in future media projects.

What is Sound?
Overview of the physics of sound and psychoacoustics. How we hear; frequency, amplitude, pitched and non-pitched sounds. Noise and types of noise. Listening to sound and developing a vocabulary to discuss it critically.

Microphones:
An investigation into the properties and operating principles of modern microphones. What the various types of microphone are and how we chose the best one for a particular application. Inverse square law, phase cancellation and proximity effect as related to the use of microphones.

Production Sound Recording:
Single and Dual system recording is explored in the context of recording dialog for fiction and non-fiction films. Location mixers, recorders, laviller and shotgun microphones will be examined and utilised in practical exercises. Correct protocols and techniques for on set dialog recording will investigated with a consideration of the aesthetics of dialog recording. Critical listening to identify and correct sound recording errors will be developed.

Post Production:
Delivering production sound to the editor including correct sound coverage and a complete sound report will be explored. Synchronising sound and image in picture editing software and exporting  sound and image from this software using the correct output formats. Basics of editing sound in audio editing software with an emphasis on understanding how production recording influences post production sound editing. Post production processing techniques including noise reduction, compression and EQ will be introduced and examined.

Class assignments:
There are four in class dialog recording assignments that explore various shooting scenarios and recording systems. The final 2 assignments include a dialogue editing component. There will also be 2 in class quizzes covering more theoretical aspects of sound, sound recording and post production.

Consisting of a series of lectures, film viewings and workshops, Documentary Filmmaking explores the different t genres and practices of the cinematic non-fiction film form. The course covers a brief history and theory of the documentary as political propaganda, investigative essay, personal journal, and cinema verite observation, through the study of documentary auteurs. You will develop an understanding of the ethical precepts, as well as an appreciation of the aesthetics and intellectual rigour of the documentary form. 

Through practice, you will be exposed to the fundamentals of documentary filmmaking. The course seeks to develop your ability to identify, conceptualise and research a topic, negotiate access to characters or events, manage a production through efficient budgeting and scheduling, and create a short non-fiction cinematic narrative with coherent artistic vision and intellectual purpose. 

Assessment will take the form of:

Documentary Film project 
Working in groups of 2, teams will write, shoot, direct and edit a video documentary. You may shoot no more than 60 minutes of video per group and the finished films should be 4-6 minutes long, complete with titles and credits. Includes oral pitches. The films are to submitted as self-contained MOV files.  

Continuous Assessment
Continuous assessment components include both written and studio-based exercises.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

Through weekly slide lecture presentations by the professor, assigned weekly readings, quizzes, and group presentations, you will learn about various photo inventions, movements, and works in relation to diverse socio-historical-art contexts. 

By studying the past, you will learn to use history to  inspire and understand new ways of seeing and visualizing the future in your chosen medium or academic pursuit.

All assignments and images will be  posted to the class OSS web page.

In the first part of the course you will look at the developments of the medium up to the modern era. Beginning with the first description of the `elusive image? in antiquity and the first discoveries in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, illustrated lectures will trace the parallel development of artistic, commercial, scientific and social applications of photography. Attention will be paid to the relationship of creativity to technical innovation, especially in the early years in Europe and the US when photographers functioned simultaneously as artists, inventors and scientists. In addition, as the ongoing pendulum swings between documentary ?truth telling? methods and artistic pictorial, conceptual concerns will be examined.These directions wil be traced as well to South East ASIA.
In the second part of the course you will be directed towards the different schools of photography, which from the beginning of the twentieth century started to be clearly defined, from documentary to pictorial to commercial. Closer examination of works by individual photographers will be viewed in tandem with theoretical issues that have emerged in recent scholarship and debates.
Review and Enhancement: Each class begins a group presentation presenting 3 topics researched in more detail from the previous class lecture

The overarching theme of this new century is the rapid rate of change on the planet and its hastening effect on climate change. The challenge is to learn to collaborate and develop cross-disciplinary partnerships as well as new skills to engage with these complex problems.

How can art open minds and hearts in order to act? How can scientists use research in a compelling and approachable matter for all to be concerned? How can artists learn to use scientific research for creative outcomes? How can scientists be artists and artists be scientists? This is the challenge of this course. 

Renowned artist/scientists who focus on ecological issues will be discussed. Field trips will include visits to areas concerned with ecological restoration and preservation e.g. waste and water remediation sites, wetlands, gardens, and nature preserves. Students will be required to read, research, and explore media and studio techniques beyond their known disciplines. Art studio as well library research time is required. 

The first meeting will outline ecological issues and cutting-edge research; the second meeting will discuss ecologically focused artists? work and critical responses.  Simple studio practices including drawing and other design tools, collage, and photography will be introduced guided by ADM students and faculty. Key readings and scientific practices will be guided by ASE students and faculty. This course addresses two of NTU?s main concerns: Sustainable Earth and Interdisciplinary Practice.

You will begin this course with an overview of the terms and contexts you will use. The first weeks cover a range of ecological topics, and how art and science work together to examine, critique, raise awareness and explore solutions.

From week 4 you will experience a more closely focused examination of ecology, loosely grouped under 5 elements: earth, air, fire, water, and energy sources. You will also be conducting research, written and visual, and forming a research topic portfolio.

From week 8 collaboration between artists and scientists begins. You will examine at a range of examples as a range of collaboration methods are discussed.

Throughout the entire course, you, in collaboration with others, will be gradually forming a project. In weeks 11 to 13, the focus intensifies to the resolution of this project, with a final 15-minute presentation in week 13.

The surface design of an object is an integral part of the object itself. It can be decorated in such a way that key aspects of the object?s function are encoded or it may serve only to present an engaging aesthetic. It may be a thing that has been applied onto the surface or it may be integral to the material and the object itself. Surface Design is a studio course. Students will learn how to apply designs onto a wide range of surfaces and materials using a range of techniques. Students will be introduced to surface design through projects involving the researching of visual sources, idea development through drawing and colour sketches and final output.

It is your assignment to research and conceptualise a wearable that addresses one of these themes, be it through acoustic or visual signals, through motion, or by controlling a media environment. There are many possibilities for input sensing, from accelerometers to temperature sensors, and the goal is to create the ideal mapping of input and output, embedded appropriately in the garment or accessory. At the end of the project you should have a functioning reactive/interactive wearable, which you will give a unique title and refine for presentation. Clarify the context in which this work is situated; reflect on the message, significance and the scope of the outcome. Write a text for your project, starting with a short description and then followed by an elaboration of the intention and meaning. Make digital presentation/documentation materials of your work. Document your work through text, photos and video, and if applicable, any other suitable media. Make sure the materials present your work in the best possible way.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

Class assignments:
During lectures or at tutorial times, you will discuss the topic and themes that have arisen. You will also be given tasks to discuss and complete. At mid-semester you will give a short presentation that answers a specific animation history challenge. At the end of the course, you will submit a written response that addresses a specific issue in animation history.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.

This course shows students how to create interface designs that are efficient in their use of resources, can serve complex needs without confusing the user, are elegant and enjoyable to use and are structured in a rational and consistent manner. The subjects of usability and the user's experience are critically discussed and explored. Students will develop the practical skills needed to make the user's interaction a productive and pleasurable experience. Students develop online and device-cantered interfaces that are both informative and interactive, whilst developing their understanding of the underlying structures that the interface hides from and reveals to the user.

Pattern Classification:
Introduction to pattern terminology (repetition, element, motifs and meta motifs) and pattern classification (decorative, conversational, figurative, abstract, and geometric).

Designing Pattern Collection:  
Part 1: The overview of essential methods of illustration for pattern motifs such as sketching, collecting of inspirational visual reference and translating gathered materials into mood-board. 
Part 2: Introduction to the essential tools used in working further from sketches for development of finished motifs, such as translating drawn elements into a single motif and into meta-motifs, digital tracing, layering, adding custom color palette and texture. 

Designing a Seamless Repeating Pattern:
An exploration of strategies to construct a variety of seamless repeat pattern variations and a simple and complex design composed of one or more motifs, multiplied and arranged in orderly sequence. Explained and practiced concepts and the construction principles of each pattern type, as well as the effects of the gradation, scale, texture and optical illusions. The overview of the pattern repeats systems such as block, drop, half-drop, brick, irregular, composite, sateen, etc., will be illustrated by examples from French Art Deco, Neolithic vase decoration, Celtic stone cross carving, North American Indian beadwork, medieval Italian silk, Persian manuscript illuminations, Chinese cloisonne, and many more.

Pattern Applications:  
You will identify the different requirements for conceiving specific use of the pattern and learn how to apply their patterns to mock-up. Following the overview of the range of pattern applications for all kind of designs, from textiles and fashion to graphic design, wall and floor coverings for architecture and interior design, you would develop a prototype for large-scale interior application.  

How to Design Pattern Collection Portfolio:
The topic will help you familiarize yourself with the terms and highlight important steps in crafting perfect professional engaging pattern collection portfolio.
  
Class assignments:
Four creative projects will explore surface design pattern: designing mood-board and pattern motifs, seamless pattern repeat designs, pattern design application and final pattern collection portfolio. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.
