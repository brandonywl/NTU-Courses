The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

Marketing typically deals with identifying and meeting human and social needs. In the center of every marketing strategy stands the consumer. Being able to examine consumers' behavior helps firms and organizations improve their marketing strategies. This course will provide you with the necessary theories and methods to better understand how consumers behave. In particular this course will focus on issues such as 
	The psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and select between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products)
	The psychology of how the consumer is influenced by his or her environment (e.g., culture, family, signs, media);
	The behavior of consumers while shopping or making other marketing decisions;
	Limitations in consumer knowledge or information processing abilities influence decisions and marketing outcome; 
	How consumer motivation and decision strategies differ between products that differ in their level of importance or interest that they entail for the consumer; and
	How marketers can adapt and improve their marketing campaigns and marketing strategies to more effectively reach the consumer.

Good marketing is no accident, but a result of careful planning and execution. There is constant tension between analysis of how consumers act under certain circumstances and the translation of these findings into creative marketing strategies. The course is organized in a way that it trains students how to integrate both consumer behavior analysis and creativity into a meaningful strategic symbiosis.

Market intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting both internal and external sources of marketing information so as to enable the company to better understand the market environment in which it competes, thus equipping managers with the timely knowledge to make well-informed marketing decisions in a dynamic environment. Students will learn about traditional and contemporary (e.g., social media) sources of market intelligence, as well as the tools for gathering intelligence information about customers and competitors. Besides acquainting students with a broad overview of market intelligence, this course is also designed to equip students with the skills to design, conduct, and interpret marketing research. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge by completing a marketing research project. Upon graduation from this class, students should be able to understand the basic principles of market intelligence, be familiar with the tools available, and have a reasonable understanding of how they are applied in the marketplace.

The primary theme of the course is that service organizations require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy, both in its development and execution. A second theme of the course focuses on the role of service in manufacturing businesses. 

This course will suggest ways that firms in the manufactured goods sector might use 'service' as a primary source of competitive advantage. The design and delivery of services depends on the close coordination between marketing, operations management, information technology and human resources. As a result, an effective strategy to market services must be interdisciplinary in nature.
	
The seminars adopt an active-learning approach so that the student can discover, develop and transform knowledge which he/she can retain for further processing and reconstructionin the future. Activities consist of interactive lectures, discussions and presentations and out-of-classroom group projects. The primary aim of these activities is to help the student better understand the concepts, theories and tools learnt and relate themto the real world.

The brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically its most valuable assets. Product designs and manufacturing processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that cannot be easily reproduced. In recent years, many firms are realizing the importance of branding and are putting more resources in this area. People who have a good knowledge of brand management are in constant demand. In view of this trend, the purpose of this course is to equip students with the knowledge in the latest branding theories and techniques. 

The course will cover the broad theories on branding and also the more specific do?s and don?ts in the implementation. Significant amount of time will also be spent discussing actual branding success and failure stories to allow students better relate the theories to brands they are familiar with. Upon completion of the course, students will hopefully have a better idea of how to build and manage brands over time.
