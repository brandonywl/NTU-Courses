This course introduces quantitative risk theory with applications to cyber risk management and insurance. The cyber threat landscape is ever evolving and cyber security needs to be considered as a continuous effort to enable better protection, detection and mitigation of attacks. A key element of managing cyber risk is quantification of cyber risks (attack vs. defense). Firstly, this course introduces the concepts, terminologies in cyber security and the latest cyber threat landscape. Secondly, this course presents metrics and probability models for quantifying cyber threats, vulnerability and loss impact to an organization, and using these models to quantify the effect of security measures in reducing cyber risk. Thirdly, this course discusses the risk management aspects, including requirements of firms to be in compliance to cybersecurity law and regulation. The role of cyber insurance is discussed as a risk management and risk transfer tool. Students are expected to perform data analysis and case studies.

This is an introductory course in finance for non-business and non-accounting students, which provides students with a broad understanding of the principles and practice of Business Finance/Financial Management.   The emphasis is on the major financial decisions made by companies and the valuation of investments made by them.  The course starts by examining the various forms of businesses and the importance of interest rates.  Time value of money, and the linkage between risk and return, lays the foundation for evaluating the price of bonds and stocks.  Students will learn and apply principles of capital budgeting (calculating the profitability of various projects and deciding which one to proceed) and capital structure (financing approved projects by issuing shares or bonds, or using retained earnings).  The decision to use extra cash to pay dividends or repurchase shares will be analysed and the course concludes with the use of derivatives to protect and enhance the value of firms.

Students intending to take this course should be numerate (good and comfortable with mathematical calculations and formulas) e.g. they should know well compound interest calculations, Sum of Geometric Progression (G.P.) calculation before attending this course.
