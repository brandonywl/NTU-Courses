A thematically structured critical introduction to the subject of history: its meanings,
frameworks, interpretations, schools of thought, practitioners and its uses and abuses.
The subject will analyze both the traditional and new methods of studying, analyzing
and interpreting the past and its relationship to our present and the future. This exciting
debate on the concepts, practices and critiques of history will be framed by in-depth
analysis of selected case studies that provide further critical insights into the discipline
and its relationship with other scholarly disciplines.

In Asia-Pacific in Global History: Pre-1800, students embark on a vicarious journey
through time to revisit numerous events, historical personages, and civilizations and
societies, for some of which only dilapidated architecture remains. This course begins
its narrative with prehistory and investigates how the earliest complex societies
developed in the Asia-Pacific regions, such as the Indus Valley and Yellow River region
of China. The story spans several millennia from the earliest known appearance of
human beings based on fossil remains through the development of societies in Asia and
the Pacific up 1800 when different regions could be said to have become integrated into
a global system. The course applies -archaeology of knowledge? (Foucault) approach to
the study of Asia Pacific from prehistory to 1800; students begin their study from the
most recent period and work their way back to the earliest. This survey course will
reveal a dynamic world of encounter, cooperation, conflict, interaction, and war.
Through 13 weeks of lecture, students can expect to inject themselves into historical
events, be it the numerous wars and conflicts of the mainland Southeast Asian polities,
the Mongols, and the Korean kingdoms, the political intrigues within the court of
Ayudhya and Xi An, or the death and destruction caused by the plague throughout 14th-
century Asia and Europe.

This course introduces students to the ancient civilizations of the world and to give them
the opportunities to investigate how many societies came about and why did they
develop in the regions they did. The course will also enable students to observe the
links between present tangible and intangible ideas and objects and that of the past. In
some cases, there are tenuous connections, but in most cases, the world we live in
today still bear the many vestiges of earlier complex societies and their peoples.
Students will learn to formulate research questions about the pre-1500 world, attempt to
draw observations about the connections which were made across the globe before
modern globalization, and gain an overview about the history of the world, which may
prove important to understanding the world as we see it today.

British colonialism had important impacts upon colonized societies and understanding colonialism is important to understanding our contemporary post-colonial moment.  This course examines the ways different forms of colonial power intersected with race, gender and class.  With a focus on the British Empire, we will look at the manner in which colonial governments sought to settle, trade, govern, 'civilise,' know, and link the Empire.  Students will enter into debates about the nature of British colonial power: was it a unified project or unstable, violent or intimate?  We will analyse the relationship between the British metropole and the colonies, including the flow of ideas, people and goods within imperial networks and the 'counterflows' from colonial sites back to Britain.  This course also asks how colonised people interacted with British colonial governments and institutions and how race, class and gender structured interactions between and amongst the colonisers and the colonised. We will examine everyday strategies colonised people adopted, from challenging colonial power to collaboration, as well as look at settler and anti-imperialist nationalisms.  This course will examine `settler colonies' and `exploitation colonies' across the globe, but will have particular focus on colonies in Asia and the Pacific.

This course examines the culture, society and politics of Britain after 1945. In a broad sense it explores the political, economic and intellectual consequences of imperial decline. It analyses the ways in which national life both joyfully and painfully adapted to a new world order, and the ways in which new forms of social expression in Britain variously rubbed against, reached an accommodation with, and sometimes enhanced, much older and more far-reaching ambitions to wield influence on an international stage.

This course begins with a general introduction to US relations with the Middle East and Islamic world in the broader region from the early twentieth century to the present. Here, you will become familiar with the foundations of the Arab-Israeli conflict, unleashed after World War One by the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the rapid expansion of European imperial power in the Middle East. Thereafter, you will study how American intervention in the Middle East unfolded and intensified after the Second World War severely weakened the European powers. Seminal events that you will examine include US competition with the Soviet Union for clients and allies in the Middle East and Persian Gulf; American efforts to satisfy the competing demands of Arab and Jewish nationalism; US meddling in revolutionary nationalist movements such as those in Iran, Iraq and Libya; rising American dependence on Middle East/ Persian oil from the 1960s onward; the oil crises of the 1970s, the Middle East peace process following the Six Day War of 1967, the Palestinian nationalist movement from the 1970s; the Soviet-Afghan War and Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, the first Gulf War of 1991, the rise of Al Qaeda from the late 1980s, the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq that have now become the longest wars that the US has ever been embroiled in.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

HW0105 is a foundation course with the broad aim of enabling HASS students to recognise and use an appropriate style of communication in academic settings related to various fields within the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage them to critically evaluate and write about issues from multiple perspectives before they develop their own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as students go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus. This course aims to equip students with the necessary skills for reading and thinking critically and writing effectively by:

1. analysing and evaluating academic texts;
2. cultivating an awareness of audience, context and purpose in writing tasks;
3. developing rhetorical skills relevant to the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in Singapore;
4. engaging with texts from a range of disciplines.
