The overarching theme of this new century is the rapid rate of change on the planet and its hastening effect on climate change. The challenge is to learn to collaborate and develop cross-disciplinary partnerships as well as new skills to engage with these complex problems.

How can art open minds and hearts in order to act? How can scientists use research in a compelling and approachable matter for all to be concerned? How can artists learn to use scientific research for creative outcomes? How can scientists be artists and artists be scientists? This is the challenge of this course. 

Renowned artist/scientists who focus on ecological issues will be discussed. Field trips will include visits to areas concerned with ecological restoration and preservation e.g. waste and water remediation sites, wetlands, gardens, and nature preserves. Students will be required to read, research, and explore media and studio techniques beyond their known disciplines. Art studio as well library research time is required. 

The first meeting will outline ecological issues and cutting-edge research; the second meeting will discuss ecologically focused artists? work and critical responses.  Simple studio practices including drawing and other design tools, collage, and photography will be introduced guided by ADM students and faculty. Key readings and scientific practices will be guided by ASE students and faculty. This course addresses two of NTU?s main concerns: Sustainable Earth and Interdisciplinary Practice.

You will begin this course with an overview of the terms and contexts you will use. The first weeks cover a range of ecological topics, and how art and science work together to examine, critique, raise awareness and explore solutions.

From week 4 you will experience a more closely focused examination of ecology, loosely grouped under 5 elements: earth, air, fire, water, and energy sources. You will also be conducting research, written and visual, and forming a research topic portfolio.

From week 8 collaboration between artists and scientists begins. You will examine at a range of examples as a range of collaboration methods are discussed.

Throughout the entire course, you, in collaboration with others, will be gradually forming a project. In weeks 11 to 13, the focus intensifies to the resolution of this project, with a final 15-minute presentation in week 13.

Learning Objective : 
	To provide general understanding of air quality assessment and the background for management with respect to the problems of air pollution.
	To assess air quality monitoring and to understand policy-making in response to air quality issues.
	To provide an overview on the selection of air pollution control technology.

Course Content :
This introductory course provides an overview of air quality management. Topics include background of air quality monitoring, types of air pollutants and related health impacts, pollutant sampling and measurement devices, pollutant distributions and dispersal modes as well available methods to control the pollutants.  Control management includes both physical and chemical mechanisms, as well as other policy/regulation approaches.

This course examines the theory and implementation of language policy and language policy in various polities and jurisdictions. Throughout the course, consideration is given to the application of knowledge gained to real world situations. We will examine various notions of what language policy consists of, how it operates, its historical roots, and ways it can be studied empirically.
