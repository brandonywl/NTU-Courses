How do we speak the unspeakable? How do we talk about sex? Why do we talk about it the way we do? And why do we not talk about it when we don?t? Why is sex often taboo?... How do we construct our sexual subjectivities and how do we perform our sexual identities through language-in-use?... Do gays and lesbians have their own language(s)? What are the `labels? that have been applied to non-conformist sexual choices and non-heterosexual orientations throughout history? How have they changed? How and why do some of them get reclaimed and re appropriated by the very same people they were intended to offend and discriminate against? And how are some other offensive labels resisted and rejected? What are the main sociocultural and political significances of these linguistic interventions? What does language have to do with identity politics? What are the main achievements of the sexual political movements? And what are their shortcomings?... How do we verbalize our erotic desire?... How do we represent our sexuality online, and how do we construct discursively what/whom we want, or do not want?... Why are sexual jokes and innuendoes funny and/or provocative and socially disruptive even when not a single ?bad word? is used? 

These are among the questions we?ll be tackling throughout this course by examining a wide range of examples from around the world. We will critically reflect on insights and concepts from sociolinguistics, sociology, anthropology, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, literary criticism, media studies and related social sciences and humanities in order to develop an integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological toolbox which we will apply when analyzing the linguistic and discursive aspects of human sexuality. 

The course will provide ample opportunities for students to get hands-on experience by analyzing and discussing real-life language data. Students will be expected to do all the assigned readings on time, submit their reading notes and discussion questions the night before the class, and actively participate in our in-class discussions. 

Parental advisory: occasional explicit content! We will occasionally deal with ?strong language? throughout this course. The course is not suitable for those who may find such content objectionable. There will be no pornography in this course.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

The course introduces fundamental topics in Orality in Linguistics and Oral Culture and Literature. It would consist of a basic introduction to linguistic strategies in the transmission of traditional knowledge in preliterate cultures all over the world, from Antiquity (Homer and the Homeric poems), to the Middle Ages (the Irish Filid, the original Old Norse poetry), to our times (the Serbian Guslari, the studies on orality by Marcel Jousse), plus a specific focus on indigenous cultures in Australia and Africa, and in South-East Asia.
The course will provide the students with a general and accurate overview of the above-mentioned topics, associating notions of Language Documentation and Language Description with elements of Anthropological Linguistics, Philology, and Comparative Literature. 

The course examines the epistemological issue of orality, culture, and literacy both from the point of view of basic original and theoretical principles established by the best scholars in this discipline (from Milman Parry, to Albert Lord, to Eric Havelock, to Marcel Jousse, to John Foley, to Ruth Finnegan, to Edgard Sienaert), and from the point of view of the direct analysis of examples of oral `unwritten texts? and oral strategies in handing down the traditional knowledge.

The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of Theoretical Linguistics and Comparative Literature. Particular attention will be given to the analysis of a number of methodological `milestones? in the study on orality, culture, and literacy, in particular to The Anthropology of Gesture by Marcel Jousse and to works by Milman Parry, Eric Havelock, Albert Lord, and Ruth Finnegan. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of orality, language, and literature in a historical and theoretical way, not only analyzing the related general issues, but also dealing with the direct application of basic principles in reading and interpreting `unwritten texts? of oral traditions from all over the world.

This course aims to provide students with necessary knowledge in using statistical tools for their own research projects.  Commonly used techniques in linguistic/psychological research, such as t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression etc., will be covered.  Students will NOT be tested on formulae, instead, the focus is on how to make use of computer software, such as Excel and SPSS, to organise data, present observation and conduct statistical analysis.  Students will also gain experience on how to write up empirical findings in a language acceptable by the field which will at the same time learn how to critically read statistics reported in prescribed readings from other courses.  Through this problem-based approach students will gain a deeper understanding of statistics.  Students who have no prior knowledge in statistics are more than welcome to enrol.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

Theories of grammar can be divided into structural, formal and functional models. Taking a selection of grammatical categories ? such as relative clauses, passive, case, subject, non-configurational syntax etc. (these may change from year to year depending upon the coordinator) ? we will compare how effective each theoretical model of syntax is in accounting for the same sets of linguistic data. The topics for investigation will be determined in the first seminar in consultation with students; these will then be considered from the perspective of (i) classical structuralism, (ii) generative theories including Government and Binding, Lexical Functional grammar, and Head-driven Phrase structure Grammar, and finally (iii) Functional-Typological theories such as Role and Reference Grammar and usage-based models such as Radical Construction Grammar.

In this unit we focus on how we understand what someone is trying to communicate to us when they say or write something to us, especially how the particular words and structures are used for the purpose of getting us to understand just what the speaker intends. Given that the meaning of a word or structure depends on how it is used, we will look at the physical and cultural contexts within which communication occurs and develop an understanding of the role they play in the communication of meaning.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

The course will cover three main areas: experimental design, acoustic methods, perceptual methods. It is necessary to fully understand the tools and techniques used to properly implement experiments and to interpret the resulting data. Emphasis is placed on the design of phonetic and phonological experiments using electronic systems and introducing computer technology for speech analysis. Therefore, in addition to the sections on experimental methodology there will be a significant portion of the course devoted to mastering computer-based acoustic analysis.

This course introduces students to the ancient civilizations of the world and to give them
the opportunities to investigate how many societies came about and why did they
develop in the regions they did. The course will also enable students to observe the
links between present tangible and intangible ideas and objects and that of the past. In
some cases, there are tenuous connections, but in most cases, the world we live in
today still bear the many vestiges of earlier complex societies and their peoples.
Students will learn to formulate research questions about the pre-1500 world, attempt to
draw observations about the connections which were made across the globe before
modern globalization, and gain an overview about the history of the world, which may
prove important to understanding the world as we see it today.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

Existentialism: Being, Freedom, Death is an introduction to the philosophical movement known as 'existentialism.' We will critically assess the central philosophical and literary works in the existentialist canon. The first half of the course focuses on the ideas of key existentialist thinkers. We examine the authors' attempts to understand the human condition with reference to three organizing themes: being (or existence), freedom, and death (or nothingness). The second half of the course focuses on the organizing themes themselves. We compare the different ways in which different existentialists approach some of the most foundational issues in philosophy. For instance: is it possible to reconcile faith in God with uncertainty about the existence of God? If God does not exist, can human existence have any meaning at all? How should we cope with the inevitability of death? Given that we are free beings, are there any standards' rational, moral, or otherwise - by which to evaluate how we ought to think, feel, and behave? Existentialists are famed for their tendency to challenge, provoke, and defy. An encounter with existentialist thought will allow students to reflect, in a very different light, on what it means to be human.
