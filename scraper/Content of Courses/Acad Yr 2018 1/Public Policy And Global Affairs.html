This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students who have never been exposed to political science studies to the fundamentals of the discipline. In so doing, students in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme (major & minor) will acquire the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical tools that would allow them to think seriously about politics. The ultimate goal is to equip students with essential political ideas and principles and enable them to apply these concepts to studying contemporary political life.

Since the early 1990s, the Internet has been viewed as an increasingly essential tool to improve public sector performance, stimulate economic growth and facilitate better governance. Many governments worldwide have invested heavily in e-government implementation in order to realize the transformative potential of e-government. In the context of a changing world, the challenges facing governments have increased. Governments are under mounting pressure to strengthen their governing capacities and foster future growth and stability. In an era of crisis and uncertainty, the study of e-government has become more necessary and important than ever before. 

The aims of this course are to enable students to gain both theoretical and empirical knowledge of e-government, and to equip students with critical thinking and problem solving skills to examine key issues in e-government.

Qualitative research is an essential tool for deeper probing of diverse social phenomena and for
designing effective public management strategies and policies. In the public administration and
policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have
contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and
environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent
researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science
research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the
analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume
research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills
for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while
studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a
qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct
qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique. 
This course is organized along the following themes: (1) introduction of qualitative research, (2)
research proposal outline, (3) developing and designing qualitative research, (4) observation
studies, (5) interviews, (6) discourse and narrative research, (7) analysis of verbal data, (8) video
data analysis, (9) case study, (10) content analysis, and (11) mixed methods.

This core course aims to develop your understanding of key concepts, principles and theories of
health care and ageing that are essential for health-related policy analysis and pursuing careers in the health care field. In addition, it aims to develop your reflective capacity and enable them to link theory to practice through examining case studies in different countries.
