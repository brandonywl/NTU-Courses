In Asia-Pacific in Global History: Pre-1800, students embark on a vicarious journey
through time to revisit numerous events, historical personages, and civilizations and
societies, for some of which only dilapidated architecture remains. This course begins
its narrative with prehistory and investigates how the earliest complex societies
developed in the Asia-Pacific regions, such as the Indus Valley and Yellow River region
of China. The story spans several millennia from the earliest known appearance of
human beings based on fossil remains through the development of societies in Asia and
the Pacific up 1800 when different regions could be said to have become integrated into
a global system. The course applies -archaeology of knowledge? (Foucault) approach to
the study of Asia Pacific from prehistory to 1800; students begin their study from the
most recent period and work their way back to the earliest. This survey course will
reveal a dynamic world of encounter, cooperation, conflict, interaction, and war.
Through 13 weeks of lecture, students can expect to inject themselves into historical
events, be it the numerous wars and conflicts of the mainland Southeast Asian polities,
the Mongols, and the Korean kingdoms, the political intrigues within the court of
Ayudhya and Xi An, or the death and destruction caused by the plague throughout 14th-
century Asia and Europe.

This course introduces students to the ancient civilizations of the world and to give them
the opportunities to investigate how many societies came about and why did they
develop in the regions they did. The course will also enable students to observe the
links between present tangible and intangible ideas and objects and that of the past. In
some cases, there are tenuous connections, but in most cases, the world we live in
today still bear the many vestiges of earlier complex societies and their peoples.
Students will learn to formulate research questions about the pre-1500 world, attempt to
draw observations about the connections which were made across the globe before
modern globalization, and gain an overview about the history of the world, which may
prove important to understanding the world as we see it today.

British colonialism had important impacts upon colonized societies and understanding colonialism is important to understanding our contemporary post-colonial moment.  This course examines the ways different forms of colonial power intersected with race, gender and class.  With a focus on the British Empire, we will look at the manner in which colonial governments sought to settle, trade, govern, 'civilise,' know, and link the Empire.  Students will enter into debates about the nature of British colonial power: was it a unified project or unstable, violent or intimate?  We will analyse the relationship between the British metropole and the colonies, including the flow of ideas, people and goods within imperial networks and the 'counterflows' from colonial sites back to Britain.  This course also asks how colonised people interacted with British colonial governments and institutions and how race, class and gender structured interactions between and amongst the colonisers and the colonised. We will examine everyday strategies colonised people adopted, from challenging colonial power to collaboration, as well as look at settler and anti-imperialist nationalisms.  This course will examine `settler colonies' and `exploitation colonies' across the globe, but will have particular focus on colonies in Asia and the Pacific.

This course examines the culture, society and politics of Britain after 1945. In a broad sense it explores the political, economic and intellectual consequences of imperial decline. It analyses the ways in which national life both joyfully and painfully adapted to a new world order, and the ways in which new forms of social expression in Britain variously rubbed against, reached an accommodation with, and sometimes enhanced, much older and more far-reaching ambitions to wield influence on an international stage.

This course begins with a general introduction to US relations with the Middle East and Islamic world in the broader region from the early twentieth century to the present. Here, you will become familiar with the foundations of the Arab-Israeli conflict, unleashed after World War One by the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the rapid expansion of European imperial power in the Middle East. Thereafter, you will study how American intervention in the Middle East unfolded and intensified after the Second World War severely weakened the European powers. Seminal events that you will examine include US competition with the Soviet Union for clients and allies in the Middle East and Persian Gulf; American efforts to satisfy the competing demands of Arab and Jewish nationalism; US meddling in revolutionary nationalist movements such as those in Iran, Iraq and Libya; rising American dependence on Middle East/ Persian oil from the 1960s onward; the oil crises of the 1970s, the Middle East peace process following the Six Day War of 1967, the Palestinian nationalist movement from the 1970s; the Soviet-Afghan War and Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, the first Gulf War of 1991, the rise of Al Qaeda from the late 1980s, the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq that have now become the longest wars that the US has ever been embroiled in.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

The Green Earth covers some of the most important themes in environmental history
which have informed academic scholarship during the last 20 to 30 years. The course
begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and
development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation
of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of
warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had
brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course
focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions
of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to
elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject
of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous
desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and
pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals,
particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction
of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several
millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have
lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at
the end of the course.

In order to understand past events, it is also important to understand why certain actors did what they did to influence the course of events. In other words, what did these actors think and how did they understand the world around them? Using an intellectual history framework, this course looks at the main themes and debates of twentieth-century China through the angle of some of its main thinkers, thereby paying attention to the specific contexts in which intellectuals put forward these ideas. Among others, we will look into socialism, liberalism, conservatism, and nationalism; the various debates we will study address the nature of Chinese modernity and its economic, political, and cultural tenets.

Starting in the late nineteenth century, when exchange programs and contact with foreigners in China led intellectuals to question their existing worldviews, this course moves chronologically and thematically across the twentieth century. From the late 1800s, we move on to intellectuals of the important May Fourth era?including thinkers of various political persuasions?as well as Mao Zedong thought. In a final section, intellectual developments of modern China will be linked to contemporary outgrowths. We will briefly discuss liberal thinkers of the so-called ?second Enlightenment? period, the 1980s, after which the course will conclude with the rise of New Confucianism and debates between the New Left and liberal intellectuals during the 1990s.

In this course, you will examine how colonial Singapore combined both western and folk medical practices in Singapore. This course will analyze the co-existence of Western tropical medicine and folk immigrant medical practices, the role of missionary nurses and doctors and their relationship to colonial medicine and policy and lastly, the course will study the use of epidemiology in Singapore during the 1918 influenza pandemic. 

The course will be divided into two six-week blocks, each covering colonial Western medicine and folk medical practices history respectively. By comparing the political, economic, and social changes that happened in the West and East during the same historical periods, we will be able to see how the interplay of global and local hegemonic forces shaped medical practices that we know today. The course would further examine Western and Eastern medical practices by studying the history of Eu Yan Sang and Tiger Balm and how it developed in colonial Singapore, the developments and contributions of hospitals and medical staffs-such as Tan Tock Seng hospital-and lastly, the 1918 Influenza Pandemic in Singapore.

War, as a quintessential part of social existence, attracts scholarship from the humanities and social sciences on issues directly or indirectly related to military conflict. Students of history are not exempt from this study as they conduct research on topics ranging from the military conflicts themselves to their long term impacts. However, the theories behind the actions taken during military conflicts remain a field of study of a niche group of military professionals and strategy researchers only. This situation creates a gap in the theoretical understanding of these military conflicts outside of this niche group.
 
This courses seeks to close this theoretical gap and to explain the theories of modern military conflict from the Napoleonic era to contemporary, through the medium of war movies.  Using some of the 20th and 21st century?s most iconic war films as a tool will aid student understanding in translating these often complex and abstract theories into practical applications.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

Existentialism: Being, Freedom, Death is an introduction to the philosophical movement known as 'existentialism.' We will critically assess the central philosophical and literary works in the existentialist canon. The first half of the course focuses on the ideas of key existentialist thinkers. We examine the authors' attempts to understand the human condition with reference to three organizing themes: being (or existence), freedom, and death (or nothingness). The second half of the course focuses on the organizing themes themselves. We compare the different ways in which different existentialists approach some of the most foundational issues in philosophy. For instance: is it possible to reconcile faith in God with uncertainty about the existence of God? If God does not exist, can human existence have any meaning at all? How should we cope with the inevitability of death? Given that we are free beings, are there any standards' rational, moral, or otherwise - by which to evaluate how we ought to think, feel, and behave? Existentialists are famed for their tendency to challenge, provoke, and defy. An encounter with existentialist thought will allow students to reflect, in a very different light, on what it means to be human.
