This 13-week programme provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in the development and regulation of healthcare products. The main area of concentration is in medical devices and is divided into four parts. The course begins with a historical introduction into the healthcare products industry and the start of regulatory controls. It then moves into the core principles of healthcare products regulations and expands into the methodologies of ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes going through the fundamentals of Good Manufacturing Practices, quality management systems, product risk classification, risk management and the different regulatory systems in the world. At the end of this course, you should have a clear understanding of healthcare products regulations and able to apply these requirements in product development. You will also be required to perform casework to test their ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios.

This course aims to introduce you to discover yourself as Homo sapience, which is a result of the evolution process for a long time. The class will focus on phenotypic differences between individuals, especially for diseases and symptoms, which are associated with genetic variants and results of evolution. You will learn about the evolution and the demographic history of humans in the population genetic perspective. Throughout the course, you will obtain essential knowledge and applications of population genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology. Also, you will learn the most advanced population genomic and human genetic studies from scientists who are conducting research projects in the field.

The aim of this one-week intensive course is to provide a hands-on approach to practical modern biological macromolecular crystallography. Briefings or introduction of the concepts and techniques related to the practical of the day will be followed by practical classes at the bench or in the computer lab. 
The intended audience is composed of undergraduates who want to use crystallographic methods during the course of their projects and/or students in the field of macromolecular crystallography, especially for 2nd major in Biomedical Structural Biology students.
Students will work in teams to solve case studies during the class and during assignments. The course also aims to foster critical examination of research papers presenting crystal structures. This course is designed for biology undergraduates in later half of their study and to further study in the related field.

This course aims to explore current topics of Immunological research in depth. In this course, you will learn how to critically review scientific findings in the field of immunology, and subsequently ask valid scientific questions. Thus, the course will extend your knowledge and further develop your critical thinking skills in the context of immunological research. You are expected to read and interpret original research publications and perform extensive literature search on selected topics in immunology. In addition to the 10 lectures of selected subjects, this course also requires you to present an assigned research paper and compose an original research proposal. Finally, you will propose experimental strategies to solve the problems in the research proposal. In this way, you are encouraged to utilize the knowledge you have acquired throughout your studies, instead of just memorizing facts. This course should help you to develop some of the problem solving skills required for a career in research.

This course aims to introduce the fundamentals of virus prophylaxis, therapeutics and diagnostics. Students will learn to recognise how viruses differ from other microorganisms, recognise the relevance of emerging virus infection in a local and international context and recognise the clinical and economic importance of virus infections. Students will be able to define some of the current focuses on virus research (in a global context). They will also be able to critically evaluate and discuss the reporting of virus disease by others e.g. in the media.

This course is continuation of a co-requisite course: BS3014 Biological Foundations of the Behavior. The outline shares same general theme as BS3014. The main difference is that we will specifically explore biology of social behaviors in the present course. Similar to BS3014, you will work in teams to unravel case studies during the class and during assignments. You will work towards analysis of social behavior from vantage points of natural selection vis-a-vis alternative explanations. The course strives to bring into sharp relief the influence of evolution on biological processes. The course also aims to foster critical examination of behavioral evidence with an equipoised interpretation of conflicting views. To paraphrase Theodosius Dobzhansky, `nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution' (American Biology Teacher 35: 125-129). Evolution provides a historical narrative within which a biologist must explain the present behaviors. The study of evolution is thus central to our understanding of biology. This course will use social behavior as a vehicle to understand relationship between past evolution and present biological manifestations. While doing this, we will also explore relationship between human societies and evolution of social behaviors. This course is designed for biology undergraduates in later half of their study program.                                                                           <P><B><FONT COLOR=red>Students who wish to read both courses BS3014 and BS4011, you must register in the same tutorial group.
