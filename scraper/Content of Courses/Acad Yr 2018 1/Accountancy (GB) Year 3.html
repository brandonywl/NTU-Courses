The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

Accounting plays a vital role in business organizations' strive for resources and performance. Through the provision of useful information, accounting helps organizations attract resources from external stakeholders, and helps internal stakeholders manage these resources, to achieve the targeted performance. The process not only facilitates the creation of value for organizations and their stakeholders, it also benefits the economy and society as a whole, by helping to direct resources to where they can be more productive.

Based upon the foundation established in the predecessor course AA101, this course focuses on the relevance of accounting information to internal stakeholders, i.e. management, to make decisions and achieve control in their strive for performance. Emphasis is placed on both the provision, as well as the application, of accounting information.

AA306 is designed to provide students with a good understanding and appreciation of the operating and financial risks that firms face, and with a strong conceptual and technical knowledge in the measurement, reporting and analysis of these risks.

To provide focus to this course, emphasis is placed on two major areas:
(a)	Firms' investment strategy as part of its risk management policy, and the resultant
         consolidated financial statements;
(b)	Firms' use of financial instruments (including derivatives) which creates or reduces risks,
         and the impact of these financial instruments on the firms? financial position and
         performances.

During the discussion, this course will draw upon students? knowledge acquired in the earlier courses, particularly, AA201 Accounting Measurement and Disclosure, and AA205 Corporate Control and Risk Management.

This course provides students with the conceptual background and analytical skills that are necessary to identify, assess and apply information for the purposes of analysing and valuing business activities and entities. The course employs the agency framework within a capital market context to help students develop the necessary analysis and valuation skills.

Emphasis is placed on integrating the use of financial and non-financial information in business valuation and analysis, involving strategy analysis, accounting analysis, financial analysis, prospective analysis and valuation. The course allows students to understand the critical issue of determining the specific types of information that are relevant in ex ante valuation and ex post analysis of business entities and their activities. Students are also expected to be aware of the benefits and costs of acquiring and using such information.
 
Cases and projects are used to develop and integrate the business analysis and valuation concepts.  Healthy scepticism is emphasized, as students are encouraged to challenge the assumptions and facts related to each issue. 

After the completion of this course, students should understand and appreciate some of the rationales and characteristics that underlie business practices and financial reporting. Students should also appreciate the myriad interactions among the process of business analysis and valuation, the use of information sets (accounting and non-accounting), and the workings of the capital markets.

Students are expected to develop important knowledge, skills and attitudes in AA301. The main objectives are to develop students? (1) social and interpersonal skills, (2) technical knowledge of specific accounting standards, (3) technical knowledge of business valuation, (4) creative and critical thinking, (5) tolerance for ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and (6) strategic thinking and leadership capabilities in a vibrant environment.
