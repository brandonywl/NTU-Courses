This course introduces students to sociological theories, methods, and research through an examination of selected social problems in a global context.  "Social problems" refers to sets of social conditions, arrangements, and practices whose resolution, or mere existence, social actors deem important. "Social problems" are social in two ways. First, social problems are constituted through human interaction. Second, social problems are socially defined and thus the meaning and significance of social problems may be contested. There are some social problems that pose practical (if different) challenges for us all. This course introduces sociological perspectives on social problems relating to poverty and inequality, work and occupations, social welfare, and the constitution and role of government.

HW0105 is a foundation course with the broad aim of enabling HASS students to recognise and use an appropriate style of communication in academic settings related to various fields within the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage them to critically evaluate and write about issues from multiple perspectives before they develop their own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as students go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus. This course aims to equip students with the necessary skills for reading and thinking critically and writing effectively by:

1. analysing and evaluating academic texts;
2. cultivating an awareness of audience, context and purpose in writing tasks;
3. developing rhetorical skills relevant to the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in Singapore;
4. engaging with texts from a range of disciplines.

What's proper reasoning and how do you tell whether an argument is good or bad? This class introduces you to formal logic, a set of powerful tools that allow us to give precise answers to the preceding questions. Along the way we will also discuss a few paradoxes - for example, how should we understand and evaluate claims about objects that don't exist, such as the claim that Santa Clause lives on the North Pole?

This course introduces the canonical thinkers (Descartes, Locke, Spinoza and Hume) in philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course challenges students to think about epistemological and metaphysical questions through these historical thinkers. Key questions include, 'What is the self?' 'What the source of knowledge?' 'Can we know the world as it is?' etc. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop high level critical thinking and writing skills by examining these historical texts and be challenged to think about the richness of philosophical issues that resulted from the new modern science.

The first part of the course introduces students to a variety of issues related to the ethical and economic foundations of businesses and markets. These include classical readings by figures such as John Locke and Adam Smith, as well as more recent readings by 20th century thinkers such as John Rawls and Milton Friedman. The second part of the course applies the foundational ideas studied in the first half to a wide variety of contemporary ethical issues in business and society. One set of topics concerns how wealth should be distributed within workplaces and societies, including debates over economic inequality, executive salaries, and how wages and other conditions of employment are set. Another set of topics concerns the broader impacts of business in a global context; key issues here include business's environmental impacts/obligations and debates over the movement of people and goods in the global marketplace. The final set of topics looks at whether the business/market model should be applied in areas outside the for profit private sector, such as politics and higher education.

Existentialism: Being, Freedom, Death is an introduction to the philosophical movement known as 'existentialism.' We will critically assess the central philosophical and literary works in the existentialist canon. The first half of the course focuses on the ideas of key existentialist thinkers. We examine the authors' attempts to understand the human condition with reference to three organizing themes: being (or existence), freedom, and death (or nothingness). The second half of the course focuses on the organizing themes themselves. We compare the different ways in which different existentialists approach some of the most foundational issues in philosophy. For instance: is it possible to reconcile faith in God with uncertainty about the existence of God? If God does not exist, can human existence have any meaning at all? How should we cope with the inevitability of death? Given that we are free beings, are there any standards' rational, moral, or otherwise - by which to evaluate how we ought to think, feel, and behave? Existentialists are famed for their tendency to challenge, provoke, and defy. An encounter with existentialist thought will allow students to reflect, in a very different light, on what it means to be human.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

What kind of thing is the mind? Can a computer be a mind? If we build an incredibly complicated and a powerful computer that does everything a mind does, would it be a mind? Can a computer be conscious? These are the kinds of questions that philosophers of mind have asked, and have
attempted to answer. This class will cover the basic positions that philosophers have taken with regard to the mind, such as dualism, behaviourism, and functionalism. It will further consider the computational theory of mind in some detail, as well as critiques of this theory, and then explore the issues of consciousness and intentionality.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

This is a class on metaphysics, epistemology, and the intersection between these two fields. Our main focus will be on us and our status in the world (both epistemologically and metaphysically), and we will be interested in questions such as the following ones: What is knowledge and how can we know anything about the external world? How should we respond when we find that our
peers disagree with us? Is our knowledge of ourselves qualitatively different from our knowledge of others? What are we anyway?

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of language. The philosophy of language is the study of the properties and workings of natural human language. It is a 'core' branch of contemporary analytic philosophy, in the sense that concepts developed by philosophers of language have proven useful in other areas of philosophy (including metaphysics, logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, and ethics). The course will focus on three linguistic phenomena. First, we examine reference, and ask how a linguistic expression can refer to things in the world. Next, we study the nature of linguistic meaning, and ask how a verbal noise or written mark acquires meaning. Finally, we explore pragmatics, and analyze the various uses of language exercised by speakers in practical contexts.
