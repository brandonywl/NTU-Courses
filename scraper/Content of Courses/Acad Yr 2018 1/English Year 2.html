This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

This course introduces students to the ancient civilizations of the world and to give them
the opportunities to investigate how many societies came about and why did they
develop in the regions they did. The course will also enable students to observe the
links between present tangible and intangible ideas and objects and that of the past. In
some cases, there are tenuous connections, but in most cases, the world we live in
today still bear the many vestiges of earlier complex societies and their peoples.
Students will learn to formulate research questions about the pre-1500 world, attempt to
draw observations about the connections which were made across the globe before
modern globalization, and gain an overview about the history of the world, which may
prove important to understanding the world as we see it today.

This is a comprehensive introduction to medieval English literature, with a focus on the Middle English period. Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic "Age of Faith" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required.

The term 'renaissance,' meaning 'rebirth', was popularized by Jacob Burckhardt in the 19th century, and has since then been inseparable from the idea that a new kind of European individual emerged between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, along with humanism, capitalism, protestantism, empirical science and European imperialism. Burckhardt was writing about Catholic Italy, however, and the individuals this course will examine lived in England, under absolutist Tudor and Stuart monarchs, during a time when the Protestant reformation was giving rise to new democratic ideologies. These writers witnessed the systematic demolition of English Catholicism, and of the feudal society that it entailed, by Henry VIII and his children. The ensuing tension between monarchy and democracy resulted in the English civil war, a conflict which produced, among other things, Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost. The texts chosen for this course demonstrate that, despite the excitement produced by new discoveries in art, science and geography, the emotion of loss suffuses the literature of the century leading up to the civil war, and this must qualify any notion that the history of the English renaissance is an unambiguous progress-narrative. Rather, it is a period fraught with contradictions, contradictions that enabled the production of some unique works of literary art.

The Age of Sensibility and Romanticism witnessed a surge of interest in emotional responsiveness, imagination, and individual subjectivity. These inward explorations coincided with a series of political, cultural, and philosophical debates that reconfigured public life and continue to shape our modern sensibilities. Taking taxonomy as an overall theme, this course begins by delineating approaches to perception, articulation, and emotion that emerged during the long eighteenth century. Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children?s books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material. Literary works, such as poetry and fiction, will be examined alongside pedagogical theory and discourses on elocution and aesthetics. Throughout the course, we will consider our own experience as readers of eighteenth-century and Romantic texts in relation to reading practice during the period. How did rising literacy rates and innovations in textual production and circulation influence literary form, genre, and taste?

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

This subject seeks to investigate various fictional images of an oft-tumultuous contemporary world from the mid twentieth century to the present. The contemporary is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of landscapes and contemporary authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television, conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery.  Many contemporary authors engage with the relativisation of various kinds of values and we will closely consider the ways in which this tendency continually resurfaces.

In this module we will be focusing on literature produced in response to the historical experience of Empire. We will look at the way in which literary narratives have been used to legitimize the imperial project - justifying its `civilizing mission', reinforcing certain racial stereotypes and hierarchies, and contributing to an archive of knowledge on colonial subjects and territories. However this complicity between literature and Empire is only part of the story. We will also be exploring the ambivalence that so often haunts the peripheries of imperial narratives, and examining the way in which literature has served to critique colonial ideologies and practices. Our discussion will be wide-ranging, both historically and geographically. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will also include analyses of Herge's

Over the last few decades, South Asian literature in English has achieved a global prominence that is unique among postcolonial literatures. In this module we will be tracing the historical development of South Asian writing from the colonial period to the present-day ? exploring, among other things, the impact of British colonial policy on its formation, the ongoing debate surrounding its use of an `imperial? language, and the reasons behind its phenomenal popularity. We will also be discussing some of the social and political issues with which this literature engages, whether it be the caste system, communal violence, or the vagaries of the postcolonial nation-state. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the Bollywood film Lagaan, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

What do literary scholars and critics do?  How do they approach literature within specific contexts?  How do they communicate with each other and with wider audiences?  What are the differences between Area Studies, Ethnic and National Studies, Cultural Studies, and Comparative Studies of literature?  What is the role of theory in literary study?  These are some of the questions addressed in this module.  Students will be exposed to various ways of reading and writing about literature, including New Criticism, literature and the other arts, structuralism and post-structuralism, new historicism, psychoanalytic and feminist theories, and ethical criticism in order to gain an understanding of the methodologies of literary analysis.  Readings and screenings will include Kiss of the Spider Woman and Dirty Pretty Things.

As we read we will consider the formulization of an "American" "Early" "Literature". Whatconstitutes "America" before 1789? Are these texts "literary"? Does our study of these textsrequire a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only Englishlanguage texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these ?secondary? histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?

This course analyzes and interprets American culture mostly from the first half of the twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, and film, looking at the way that the conditions of modernity engendered new forms that go beyond the earlier novel/romance dichotomy. We?ll study realism (Cather); naturalism in its classic, modernist, and Depression-era forms (London, Stein, Steinbeck, respectively); as well as classic modernists Eliot, Hemingway, and West, examining their experiments involving perspective, language, history, memory, and the surreal. We?ll study the dark filmic vision of film noir, focusing on patterns of corrupt morality, cold passion, and dehumanizing modernity. The short fiction of the Southern Catholic writer Flannery O?Connor will be discussed in terms of the grotesque and the cultural division of country and city. We?ll read Naked Lunch, Burroughs? shockingly experimental work examining power and addiction. We?ll conclude with a novel by Robinson that evokes a hybrid world of nature and domesticity through non-hierarchical, non-individualized discourse.

This course explores shifting attitudes towards childhood, children's literature, and their attendant
critical and theoretical discourses from the nineteenth-century to the present. You will examine the lingu istic and narrative strategies that adult writers, illustrators, and filmmakers deploy in their attempts to speak to, and for, young audiences, and the assumptions that we, as adults, bring to our encounters with historical and contemporary children's texts.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

Cinema, like all cultural products, is political in some way or other.  By deploying race, gender, and class as critical categories of reading film, this course's approach seeks to examine the political and ideological implications and assumptions of film art as a popular cultural medium.  Brief introductions to theories on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ideology, and class will provide the framework for the viewing of classic and contemporary film from different cinematic cultures.

Tracing its origins from nineteenth-century writing on the possibilities and threats both of technology and the newly established sciences to its generic reconstruction and intertextual revisiting over the centuries, the analysis of its most prominent as well as of recently rediscovered works aims to illustrate how science fiction has transformed literature and film. In this, it also seeks to map the genre?s most defining topoi: travel through space, time, and parallel universes; experimental technology; alien life; testing the boundaries of the mind and manipulating the body (cloning). Science fiction has always been experimental in its technique as well as in its critique of social, psychological, and scientific definitions of selfhood, and its study taps into encompassing explorations of epistemological as well as ontological anxieties.

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of'- and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

Eighteenth-century English readers recognized the "novel" as a new literary form that borrowed from previous narrative traditions such as the spiritual autobiography, romance, the picaresque tale, criminal biography, and travel literature. As a genre the "novel" raises questions of authority, tradition, convention, and innovation: What distinguishes creation from bastardization? What types of "mixing" are acceptable and which are not? How is something recognized as genuinely new and how is it incorporated into an existing tradition? The issue of identity is central to the "novel" as a literary form and is reflected in its subject matter. The genre enabled authors and readers to explore the subjectivity of the individual self, the constitution of identity within a specific environment, and the relationship between "self" and "other." From the new worlds made available by technological innovations such as the microscope and telescope to Robinson Crusoe's disorientation at seeing a mysterious footprint in the sand, encountering the strange, the foreign, and the shocking broadened the perspectives and possibilities of literature in novel ways.

The course will cover the development of the eighteenth century English novel as a narrative form while analyzing the different literary choices and innovations used to represent identity and its response to novelty. We will study how novelists used and adapted their narrative form to negotiate conflicts of class, nation, gender, family, religion, and literary tradition. By the end of the course, students will have a sound familiarity with the history and development of the eighteenth-century English novel and will have acquired the vocabulary and analytical tools to think critically about the form and function of the novel.

This course exposes you to current global environmental concerns through literary and nonfiction texts, art, and media; teaches you to place primary and critical sources across disciplines into conversation; and gets you to inspect your roles as readers, critics, and actors contributing to sustainable decisions.

You will learn how to draw on perspectives across fields of study to talk to colleagues, friends, and family members about the environment. You will gain the skills to critically engage interdisciplinary sources in assignments that integrate written and practical components. Assessments and a field trip incorporating practical and public engagement will let you contribute to current debates and understand how you can influence sustainable outcomes in Singapore and beyond.

In this class, we look closely at the role of the humanities in current environmental debates. We approach climate change holistically by analysing contemporary creative sources ? including literature, films and documentaries, visual art, and sculpture ? alongside environmental history, public science writing, and climate communications research. Visiting scholars and practitioners working on sustainability, as well as a field trip to Marina Barrage, will enrich our discussion.

Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World
War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.'
There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not
identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their	shared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as	 you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.

Course Content
The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the
audience to confront the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Each week, we will look	closely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in	1, class. The course will provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time, humour and suffering.

The key objective of the course is to help students to psychologically better manage their transition to the work world in the Singaporean employment landscape through an understanding of the workings of relationships in the workplace. The course contents help students to understand the reality of the prevailing employment relations and how the employment relationship have evolved in Singapore. 

The course introduces the learner to the basic three perspectives of industrial relations viz. the unitarist, pluralist and radical and it implications on relationship in the workplace between the key players in the employment landscape (viz. management, employees, union and the government). The course facilitates the learner in understanding the roles played in the Singaporean context by government as a legislator, regulator and controller, and the unions and employers in developing a harmonious work environment through tripartism. There will also be coverage of importance of manpower planning in harnessing the strengths of the players. The course will address issues related to conflict management among the players, how productivity and performance are achieved as well as current issues faced in the Singaporean employment landscape.

The underlying theme of relationships will facilitate student?s psychological ability to manage their career better on entry to the work world and develop practical skills to deal with the challenges in the employment landscape. Practical illustrations will be used during the learning process to enable students to get a good grasp of concepts, theories and principles.

Contemporary Singapore has been described by observers in many different ways. The country has been perceived by some as a model of economic success and multi-racial harmony. Others have criticized the high degree of state regulation in the nation-state. This course provides a sociological perspective on various aspects of Singapore society, from its historical formation to its post-independence social transformation. Issues to be covered include the question of national identity and culture. We examine whether Singaporeans possess a common identity and a culture to call their own.  Matters concerning the exercise of political power and the maintenance of authority will also be analyzed. We explore methods of governance that shape society and individuals. Finally, we examine social divisions, for example, class, gender, and religious affiliations. Students will learn to develop the 'sociological imagination'- the ability to relate larger societal issues and personal concerns of everyday life.

Existentialism: Being, Freedom, Death is an introduction to the philosophical movement known as 'existentialism.' We will critically assess the central philosophical and literary works in the existentialist canon. The first half of the course focuses on the ideas of key existentialist thinkers. We examine the authors' attempts to understand the human condition with reference to three organizing themes: being (or existence), freedom, and death (or nothingness). The second half of the course focuses on the organizing themes themselves. We compare the different ways in which different existentialists approach some of the most foundational issues in philosophy. For instance: is it possible to reconcile faith in God with uncertainty about the existence of God? If God does not exist, can human existence have any meaning at all? How should we cope with the inevitability of death? Given that we are free beings, are there any standards' rational, moral, or otherwise - by which to evaluate how we ought to think, feel, and behave? Existentialists are famed for their tendency to challenge, provoke, and defy. An encounter with existentialist thought will allow students to reflect, in a very different light, on what it means to be human.
