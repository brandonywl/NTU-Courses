Working from observation
In this course you will consistently work from observation in order to hone your eye and become more sensitive to the dimensional world around you. You will learn to perceive proportion both intuitively and also through measuring. You will explore concepts of composition, line work, shape design, value structure, and colour, in order to translate your ideas and perceptions into a finished drawing or sequence.

Investigating and experimenting with materials
You will be continually compelled to challenge yourself with new techniques and materials. From pen and ink, to charcoal to watercolour, this course will serve as an introduction to many new materials and processes

Finding personal aesthetic
You will continually work toward developing your pictorial goals. You will be asked to first define your specific aesthetic goals including composition, line work, lighting effects etc., and then chart a course for improving towards those goals

Integrating sketching into a creative workflow
In this class you will be encouraged to make free standing drawings that function as independent art pieces, and also to utilise drawing as a primary step in ideation.  By utilising observational as well as reference drawing, you will develop a process by which to create well informed and well observed drawings.

The course is conducted in a studio/classroom or at a site-specific place corresponding to the assignment. The instructor and students observe the progress of everyone's work, and contribute critique as it is being made. Learning is a collective experience in the classroom, and you will problem-solve on the canvas, benefitting from a cross-pollination of ideas and input from your peers. It is therefore very important that you attend all classes. 

The semester begins with representational painting using slow-drying, indirect oil painting techniques learning basic paint mixing, colour observation and composition. Gradually you will become more independent with your work. The semester ends with experimentation of modernist direct application of wet-in-wet acrylic paint. 

The course also offers opportunities to collaborate with local museum exhibitions as well as international students, artists and communities.

Course content includes:
1.	Introduction to materials: 
             primers and painting surfaces;
             properties of oil paint;

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in Art History and Theory. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their relevance to Art History and Theory in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire key critical skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and new insights.
Finally, you will present your responses, in the form of a written paper and oral presentations.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the questions and issues it provokes. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Paper.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

The course is an introduction to the history and development of different forms of contemporary artistic practice considered under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point of the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from painting, sculpture and other traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition characterized by novel expressions of spatiality, (im)materiality, interactivity and immersiveness, among others. At this point, the course approaches the association between new technological resources and linguistic and expressive demands within the field of visual culture. New visual genres and fields encompassed in the survey include electronic, digital and computer art; video/computer games and interactive media; internet, mobile and network art. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found in New Media a significant field of exposure and development, such as post-humanism, hyper-reality, bio-aesthetics, cyber culture and information society.

This course explores European visual culture created in response to contact and interaction with non-Western cultures from the fifteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Various European representations of the exotic Orient (Near and Far East) will be examined. The influence of European Imperialism upon the fine arts will be analysed in relation to eighteenth-century colonial landscape painting, the Romantic Orientalism of Eugene Delacroix, the work of Jean-Auguste Dominque Ingres and Jean-Leon Gerome, the popularization of the East in terms of Chinoiserie and Japonisme, primitivism in the work of Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso, and the odalisques of Matisse. The course will also look at the rise of ethnography and the ethnographic museum, and the role of photography and international exhibitions.

Following the course DD3005 Survey of Modern Art, 1900-1945, which ends in 1945, the course DD3013 From Modern to Post-Modern Art 1945-1985 completes the full chronology of Art History from the introductory modules that explore the ancient and the classical, right through to modern, post-modern and contemporary forms. The course examines a period of forty years of European and American art history that laid the foundations for today's art.  It encompasses post-World War II High-Modernism, 1960s and 1970s Anti-Modernism, and 1980s Postmodernism. Broadly chronological in approach, the course begins with an in-depth study of the different forms of Abstract Art in the post-war period, before embarking into a survey across some of the most important artistic movements in the 20th century. It includes Art Brut and Outsider Art, Nouveau Realisme, Pop Art and Photorealism, Op and Kinetic Art, Fluxus and Performance Art, Conceptual Art, Minimalism, Arte Povera, Environmental and Land Art, Neo-Historicism and Graffiti Art. 

New approaches to art making, and critical frameworks used to discuss and interpret modern art will also be considered in relation to the historical contexts in which they were produced, including, but not limited to: the politics of the Cold War period; the rise of consumerism in the 1950s; the civil rights movement and institutional critiques of the 1960s; the, the growth and influence of feminism in the1970s and the crisis of representation and meta-narratives in the1980s.

Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be required to respond to any one of a broad range of issues in film practice. The topics include a range from historical to contemporary and are selected for their immediate relevance to film practice in society and culture.

Once the topic is revealed, you will be required to research ? to analyse and scrutinise from differing points of view so as to understand the context of the issue. Based on your research, you will form a strategy to further your exploration. This will take several routes, depending on the topic and the nature of your response. You will be required to acquire any necessary skills and knowledge in order to continue your investigation, as you work towards a response, and possible solution.

Finally, you will present your response, describing your analysis, strategy, process, which will move toward your proposed film project.

Class structure will vary and is in large part determined by the nature of the topic and the nature of the response. Some maturity and the ability to work independently is expected in this course.

Class assignments
The base structure for assignments is two major assessment points: 
1.	Mid-semester presentation
2.	Final Project Presentation and handin.

Class activities, discussions and critique will contribute towards continuous assessment.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

Through weekly slide lecture presentations by the professor, assigned weekly readings, quizzes, and group presentations, you will learn about various photo inventions, movements, and works in relation to diverse socio-historical-art contexts. 

By studying the past, you will learn to use history to  inspire and understand new ways of seeing and visualizing the future in your chosen medium or academic pursuit.

All assignments and images will be  posted to the class OSS web page.

In the first part of the course you will look at the developments of the medium up to the modern era. Beginning with the first description of the `elusive image? in antiquity and the first discoveries in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, illustrated lectures will trace the parallel development of artistic, commercial, scientific and social applications of photography. Attention will be paid to the relationship of creativity to technical innovation, especially in the early years in Europe and the US when photographers functioned simultaneously as artists, inventors and scientists. In addition, as the ongoing pendulum swings between documentary ?truth telling? methods and artistic pictorial, conceptual concerns will be examined.These directions wil be traced as well to South East ASIA.
In the second part of the course you will be directed towards the different schools of photography, which from the beginning of the twentieth century started to be clearly defined, from documentary to pictorial to commercial. Closer examination of works by individual photographers will be viewed in tandem with theoretical issues that have emerged in recent scholarship and debates.
Review and Enhancement: Each class begins a group presentation presenting 3 topics researched in more detail from the previous class lecture

The Right Light:
You will review basic lighting principles and the concept of camera exposure. These will include the function of light and the crucial role it plays in the photographic process, as well as, how to obtain correct exposures. This is followed by a study of how to distinguish different types of light, quantify it, determine its quality, perceive the conditions that affect it, and ultimately, recognize how these elements impact the subject and environment photographed.

The Lighting Studio:
Introduction to the lighting studio and artificial lighting as an additional platform and means which can be utilised for the production of photographs. You will learn to safely operate a variety of lighting and grip equipment and in the process familiarise yourself with studio etiquette and standard operating procedures. Focus is given to studying how light behaves and to the learning of its ability to ?transform? subject matter and scene in a space where control over variables can be exercised. Techniques to control light to obtain proper exposures, and how to shape light to create depth and dimension, emphasize texture and form will be explored in detail.

Unlimited Light:
This portion of the course is dedicated to equipping and expanding the student?s photographic skillset. You will learn how to combine natural and artificial light, and, balance the different exposure values of the sources used when photographing indoors or on location. You will critically analyse your communication needs and apply your knowledge of lighting to explore and develop appropriate solutions for photographs that are effective in realising your concepts and conveying the desired narrative.

Class assignments:
A total of seven assignments are aimed at providing you with the opportunity to grasp the principles of lighting through practice, and, to hone your technical skills in photography.

The surface design of an object is an integral part of the object itself. It can be decorated in such a way that key aspects of the object?s function are encoded or it may serve only to present an engaging aesthetic. It may be a thing that has been applied onto the surface or it may be integral to the material and the object itself. Surface Design is a studio course. Students will learn how to apply designs onto a wide range of surfaces and materials using a range of techniques. Students will be introduced to surface design through projects involving the researching of visual sources, idea development through drawing and colour sketches and final output.

In this course you will receive a chronological and thematic overview of the history and development of animation throughout the 20th century. Emphasis will be given to significant animation milestones, and how these changes reflected events or changes at the time. You will be exposed to animation as a contextual form of art and communication, performing many roles such as opinion, propaganda, advertising, personal expression, or socially-reinforcing fairy tales. The course will mainly investigate animation as an art form, with or without a narrative, of any time-span, looped, sequenced, generated in real-time, with a specific message, or as an abstract form. The course will also study the development of regional animation, particularly in the South East Asia region.
The culmination of this course will touch on the more contemporary aspects of animation today. You will learn to frame your investigations into animation history in a rigorous research framework that considers relevant approaches and correct citation formatting.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.

In this advanced course, we are aiming to encourage the students to be creative within a given framework. The course is interdisciplinary in nature and students will have to collaborate. They will be asked to organize themselves in small groups, where each individual will use skills from different disciplines to achieve the common goal: modeling, texturing, rigging and lighting skills will be necessary. The course will be open to students from other areas as well and aims to be interdisciplinary in nature. In the first part of the course, the students will learn new tools and prepare the assets for the second, more practically oriented part. In this second half of the course, they will practically integrate all those elements in one cohesive short sequence.
