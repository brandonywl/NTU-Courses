Module I : General Introduction
Module 2: The Global Seeding of Oil Palm
Module 3: Recent Expansion of Oil Palm in South East Asia: How and Why did this happen?
Module 4: How is Oil Palm Production Affecting Environment, Climate and Human Society?

HY0001 will introduce students to three major ethical theories' utilitarianism, Kant's deontology, and virtue ethics. Then, four weeks will be devoted to teaching the ethical principles underlying academic integrity, research ethics, and intellectual property. Finally, students will discuss issues related to the ethics of environmental sustainability and conservation. All the while, students will be challenged apply the ethical theories learned to concrete moral problems, including world poverty, corporate accountability and whistleblowing, and workplace discrimination.

In today's competitive world, it is essential that students learn the crucial career skills early to ensure a competitive edge sharpened with a heightened sense of workplace values and ethics.  This course takes students through a journey of career discovery, understanding and polishing of oneself which will then be translated into job application tools such as resumes and interview skills. 

All students will have the opportunity to undergo a robust Career Assessment Tool, which assesses their career options and career self and helps them chart a career action plan. They will also learn how to identify and articulate the concept of personal branding and applying that to resumes and interviews and online social media. Students will also be exposed to the basics of grooming to ensure that they are aware of the importance of first impressions in all situations.

`Communicating as a 21st Century Engineer' aims to help students in the Renaissance Engineering Programme to become highly skilled communicators. You will explore in depth how to use language appropriately and effectively, in varied academic and professional contexts, to achieve desired purposes with different audiences. While the course focuses on how to write and present dynamic technical proposals and reports, you will learn important general principles that you can apply to other forms of written and spoken communication. An important aspect of the course is that you will learn how to learn about effective communication on your own. This will involve you learning how to read, analyse and respond critically to a range of texts from engineering and other disciplines.  The course also covers non-verbal aspects of communication, such as the use of graphics, as well as ethical dimensions of academic and professional communication.

The class will examine several major essay writers from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, which will work as models to learn about the art of essay writing. These texts will also engage students with historical and cultural issues on which to reflect. Students will also use two textbooks on writing and reasoning. The main textbook will be Writing to Learn and the secondary textbook will be Reasoning and Writing Well.

The course adopts a kind of a 'circuitous' framework: it begins with 'Managing & Leading Today: The New Rules', and it ends with  'Managing & Leading for Tomorrow: Focus on Your Future'. Leadership is a focal theme in the course, as it relates to the four key roles of contemporary management (planning, organizing, controlling, and leading). The course is focused on these four key management roles. Each of the planning, organizing, and controlling roles will be examined in two parts over two seminars respectively. The role of leading, relating to the central theme of leadership, is examined in five parts over five seminars (this would include the first and closing seminar topics).
