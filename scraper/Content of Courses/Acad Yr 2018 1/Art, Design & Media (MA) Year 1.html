This course introduces you to the practice and theory of writing narratives for creative media. Narratives, the principles of storytelling, play a crucial part in much of the media and design landscape, and writing is a key tool for their construction. Narrative writing has to engage with the materiality of the media and is in a creative dialogue with form and content. During this course you will engage with and analyse notable examples, forms, techniques and ideas around narrative and storytelling, and you will begin to develop your own writing practice through a series of practical projects with the instructor and peer feedback.

HW0105 is a foundation course with the broad aim of enabling HASS students to recognise and use an appropriate style of communication in academic settings related to various fields within the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. Students will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage them to critically evaluate and write about issues from multiple perspectives before they develop their own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as students go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus. This course aims to equip students with the necessary skills for reading and thinking critically and writing effectively by:

1. analysing and evaluating academic texts;
2. cultivating an awareness of audience, context and purpose in writing tasks;
3. developing rhetorical skills relevant to the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in Singapore;
4. engaging with texts from a range of disciplines.
