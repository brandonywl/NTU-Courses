This course will provide students/student teachers with the fundamental background of key historical perspectives and current influences underpinning the developments of early childhood education (ECE), both internationally and in Singapore. Theoretical perspectives and empirical research will be used as analytical lenses to examine the key trends and issues concerning the education and care of children from the ages of 0 to 8. In the Singapore context, this will include children in the preschools and the lower primary mainstream schools. 
Examples of topics which will be explored include the concept of children and childhood, curricular approaches to ECE, concept of quality in ECE, diversity and inclusion, play and integrated learning, transition to formal schooling, relating to parents and community, and leadership, mentoring and professional development. Participants will explore how the developments in these various areas could impact learning and teaching in the lower primary classes in Singapore.
Course participants are expected to participate in critical discourses pertaining to the various topics and through the process to develop deeper appreciation and greater insights into how early childhood education has taken shape over the years and in different socio-cultural contexts. The emphasis of the course is for participants to take on a constructive stance, and develop their personal viewpoints and philosophy towards early childhood education or lower primary education, particularly within our local context.  Hence the course will embrace a learner-centred pedagogy to provide opportunities for the participants to undertake serious reflection and to assume greater ownership of their learning experiences.

We recommend that students who wish to pursue an EC minor complete AED16A and AED16D first because these two courses can greatly support you with AED16B, AED16C and AED16E.

This course will explore the concepts and fundamentals of curriculum design, and examine assessment practices which can further support the curricular goals. It will emphasize the need to view these two segments as a seamless flow of ideas to support children?s learning. 
The research evidence conclusively attests to the early years being critical years for the acquisition not only of knowledge and skills, but more importantly desirable dispositions which have a life-long impact on the children?s development. Curriculum designers for early years learners therefore need to understand children?s development in this holistic manner. This course will introduce to the students/student teachers the dynamics of curriculum development. Participants will examine the curriculum concepts and theoretical foundations underpinning the different early childhood curriculum models. In addition, they will critically evaluate the different approaches and examine their relevancy and application in relation to the socio-cultural context of the Singapore education system. 
A curricular framework should not only entail decisions of what, how and when to teach, but also how to assess the learning that has occurred. Participants will learn of current assessment concepts, and explore their roles in influencing the learning outcomes of children. Participants will also examine a wide range of assessment modes and ascertain their suitability for young learners. In particular, the role of observations and documentations will be given added attention. Participants can look forward to practical sessions in which they will be given opportunities to utilize appropriate assessment techniques to analyze young children?s behavior and development, interpret their data and undertake responsive curricular decisions.

We recommend that students who wish to pursue an EC minor complete AED16A and AED16D first because these two courses can greatly support you with AED16B, AED16C and AED16E.
