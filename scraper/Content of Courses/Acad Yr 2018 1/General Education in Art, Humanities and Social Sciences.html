This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

In this lecture course you will investigate the development of non-traditional forms of film and video making. We will take a closer look at experimental time-based art which means: the formal structure and theoretical backgrounds of significant examples will be examined. 
Apart from this closer look at the historic development of filmic experiments you will see that not only the variety of forms (videos, installations, film screenings etc.) has exploded into multiple examples of filmic experiments. Furthermore, you will explore the multiple ways in which these works are presented and reflect the diversity of environments for experimental film (galleries, museums, art fairs, online platforms etc.) which has been increasing too. 

Against the background of this development, this lecture will unfold the history and challenges of this fairly new medium from the 1890s to the present day. 

As part of the lectures, you will also visit exhibitions that include filmic works which will allow you to have a first-hand experience how film works outside its cinema frame. In this way, you will get a deeper understanding of how an exhibition experiments with moving images in space, and how the perception of this form changes with its environment. 

Through a combination of readings, screenings, class discussions and exercises an understanding will be arrived of what the ?avant-garde? in film & video can be as well as how it relates to and influences art practice in general.

The overarching theme of this new century is the rapid rate of change on the planet and its hastening effect on climate change. The challenge is to learn to collaborate and develop cross-disciplinary partnerships as well as new skills to engage with these complex problems.

How can art open minds and hearts in order to act? How can scientists use research in a compelling and approachable matter for all to be concerned? How can artists learn to use scientific research for creative outcomes? How can scientists be artists and artists be scientists? This is the challenge of this course. 

Renowned artist/scientists who focus on ecological issues will be discussed. Field trips will include visits to areas concerned with ecological restoration and preservation e.g. waste and water remediation sites, wetlands, gardens, and nature preserves. Students will be required to read, research, and explore media and studio techniques beyond their known disciplines. Art studio as well library research time is required. 

The first meeting will outline ecological issues and cutting-edge research; the second meeting will discuss ecologically focused artists? work and critical responses.  Simple studio practices including drawing and other design tools, collage, and photography will be introduced guided by ADM students and faculty. Key readings and scientific practices will be guided by ASE students and faculty. This course addresses two of NTU?s main concerns: Sustainable Earth and Interdisciplinary Practice.

You will begin this course with an overview of the terms and contexts you will use. The first weeks cover a range of ecological topics, and how art and science work together to examine, critique, raise awareness and explore solutions.

From week 4 you will experience a more closely focused examination of ecology, loosely grouped under 5 elements: earth, air, fire, water, and energy sources. You will also be conducting research, written and visual, and forming a research topic portfolio.

From week 8 collaboration between artists and scientists begins. You will examine at a range of examples as a range of collaboration methods are discussed.

Throughout the entire course, you, in collaboration with others, will be gradually forming a project. In weeks 11 to 13, the focus intensifies to the resolution of this project, with a final 15-minute presentation in week 13.

This course is a practical course that focuses on learning techniques and processes to create digital 3d models. There are two main types of digital modelling ? constructed and sculpted. Both approaches will be learned and explored as to their suitability for a range of outcomes. A wide range of mechanical and organic shapes will be developed, using a variety of techniques and level of detail. Surface colouring and lighting will be examined, as well as other surface attributes such as reflectivity, shininess, dullness, glow, wetness, as well as some discussion into complex surface textures such as hair.

The course will also cover a range of export and linking options in order to integrate into  a production scenario for animation, special effects, cinema or digital gaming.

This course will provide an overview of the science fiction film genre from its beginnings up to the present day.  While the majority of film examples will be drawn from the US, the course will also work to take a global perspective, offering several screenings of films from outside of the US.  Students will be introduced to basic concepts in genre theory, as well as familiarized with key themes and narrative and aesthetic trends in the science fiction film genre across its history.  Particular emphases of the course will include 1) the on-going significance of Cold War themes to the genre; 2) the genre's representations of science, technology, and scientists; and 3) the films' implicit positions on the ethical and moral issues that may arise in scientific research.

This course examines the ways in which madness is interpreted in selected literature and films from late 19th century onwards. Is madness a matter of perspective, biological disorder, subversion or metaphor? We examine four possible categories: the mentally ill with self-awareness of their debilitating condition; alienated individuals deviating from societal norms; mentally unsound individuals labeled insane by experts; and individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorder in enacting transgressive acts. Using close reading of literary and visual narratives, this course will discuss madness in the contexts of self-awareness, creativity, alienation and isolation, language as construct, women and representation, the institution, sexual dysfunction and violence.

This course aims to teach you to think logically and critically. It covers a broad range of logical concepts and terminology, including argument, premise, conclusion, inductive and deductive reasoning, validity, soundness, and strength. You will learn how to evaluate good deductive arguments through the study of categorical and truth functional logic, and good inductive arguments using a probabilistic framework.
Finally, you will learn about common fallacies (rhetorical, statistical, and psychological), how to avoid them, and how to clearly communicate where fallacious arguments go wrong.

Work in the 21st Century, is characterised by competition on a global scale, where jobs are becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and technology-driven, and where constant change is the rule rather than the exception.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of some areas of study within the field of behavioural science that are relevant and applicable to the work situation.  Working in the 21st Century explores the role of socio-psychological factors among individual and work group behaviour as a basis for understanding our place in the work setting.  The lecture topics present four areas of interest - personality and work, occupational health, learning-performance, and career development.  While each section is designed to be a stand-alone module, all the four areas of study are fully integrated within the general context of the work situation in organisations.  Empirical findings from applied research are used to explain psychological principles and concepts and the course emphasizes a practical approach to applying psychology in the workplace.

Are you OK? We often ask each other this question. We are often concerned about the psychological well-being of our family members, friends, and, most importantly ourselves. In this course, we will discuss issues concerning psychological well-being and mental health in Singapore: the early signs of not being "OK", when you might need professional help, and where you might find the appropriate help. The course will be taught by a seasoned mental health practitioner in Singapore, in collaboration with our in-house faculty members.

In today's fast-paced and competitive work environment, a student is often lost as to how and where to find jobs and how to manage one's career. This course will provide an introduction to the contemporary human resource management functions: employment, employee relations, training and development, performance systems, compensation, benefits, and human resource information systems. It is not the objective of this course to train students to be HRM managers, but to provide basic information for students to plan and manage their own careers.

Today, we are living in an interconnected and culturally diverse world. This subject analyzes what happens when different cultures meet and how cultures are 'socially constructed'. Cultures are not monolithic constructs. People continuously negotiate cultural content in relation to a wide variety of factors. Globalization has accelerated and broadened various forms of cultural negotiation. The principal themes of this subject include: cultural capital, dominant cultures, sub-cultures, colonialism, Westernization, consumption, hybridity, popular culture and translocal culture.
