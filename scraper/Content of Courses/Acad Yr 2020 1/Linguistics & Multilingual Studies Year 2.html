This course introduces you to the varieties of Mandarin Chinese as surfaced in Chinese speaking communities such as Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We will illustrate with rich examples the differences in the writing system, sound, lexicon, grammar, and pragmatics found in Chinese varieties, and discuss the linguistic, historical, cultural, and social factors that have led to the differences. The course will help you get a deeper and wider understanding of language variation and change, and facilitate more effective communication with Mandarin speakers from different regions. The course is useful for future careers relevant to Chinese including language teaching, editing, translation, etc.

The objectives of this course are to provide you with the foundations for reading and	understanding classical Chinese texts. This is done through a brief introduction to classical Chinese grammar, with special reference to grammatical features of essential parts of speech, usage of function words, peculiar word order and peculiar syntactic constructions. You will learn to make distinctions in classical Chinese grammar through comparison with modern Chinese grammar, and hence strengthen their ability to understand classical Chinese in reading.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

Traditionally linguistic analysis was done largely by hand, but computer-based methods and tools are becoming increasingly more widely used in contemporary research. This course provides an introduction to the key instruments and resources available on the personal computer that can assist the linguist in performing fast, flexible and accurate quantitative analyses. Students will learn a scripting language (Python) and use it and the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) to analyse linguistic phenomena. The following topics will be covered in detail:
	File input/output
	Control Structures
	Frequency Distributions
	Regular Expressions
	Access to lexical resources
	Classification

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

The course begins with an overview of natural language processing (NLP) to situate speech synthesis and recognition within industry and reviews familiar applications of these systems. Necessary topics concerning phonetics and phonology are introduced/reviewed, with a particular focus on acoustic phonetics. The topic of speech synthesis is then covered, with a focus on concatenative synthesis and statistical parametric systems, but formant-based and articulatory synthesis will also be covered in detail. In relation to these latter topics, students will learn about modeling the structures of the vocal tract to produce articulatory-based systems and the types of applications these have in speech research. Next the topic of speech recognition is covered. Students will learn about the design parameters of these systems and the tie-ins with other topics in NLP (such as language models and syntactic and semantic parsers). The Hidden Markov Model will be discussed in detail and its application to the task of recognizing speech in conjunction with acoustic analysis and modeling of the speech signal.
