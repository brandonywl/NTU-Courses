and interpreting the past and its relationship to our present and the future. This exciting
debate on the concepts, practices and critiques of history will be framed by in-depth
analysis of selected case studies that provide further critical insights into the discipline
and its relationship with other scholarly disciplines.

This course will introduce you to the history of cultures of the Asia-Pacific regions covering the period from the rise of the state until 1800 with a focus on everyday life for the ruling classes and their subject populations. In addition to scholarly accounts of family life, state-formation, sexuality, economics, and religion, you will read literature from a variety of contexts in order to develop an intimate relationship with the individuals and groups in each culture. This literature will include ancient Indian epic, Confucian texts on the state and family, the Komasatra, and stories from the Tang and Song dynasties. In this course, you will also consider modern anthropological parallels in order to bring to life the familial, cultural, social, and political worlds of pre-colonial India, China, and Southeast Asia.

This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international?that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

This course analyses ideas about gender and sexuality in the modern world, as well as the experiences of modern men and women.  In this course, we rethink modern categorisations of gender and sexuality.  Students will deconstruct dual gender systems through analysing diverse gender roles and multiple genders in different parts of the world.  We will analyse how gender has intersected with various dimensions of modernity, including: class and domesticity; labour; imperialism and race; citizenship and nationalism; sexuality and the body; ideas about crime; and forms of popular culture and mass media.  Students will gain an understanding of how contemporary ideas about gender and sexuality are historically specific.

In this course, you will examine and deconstruct the category 'Malay' as a lens into the broader processes of making and unmaking group identities in the maritime Southeast Asia region that historically used the Malay language as a trade lingua franca. You will conceptualize how Malay ethnic identity is an ongoing process and group boundaries develop with culturally specific markers along five major axes: economy, geography, political authority, religion and gender. As the course spans the pre-modern and modern periods, it will offer you an opportunity to compare and contrast how these processes change over time. Given the paucity of conventional documentary archives in accessing this history, you will develop new skills in interpreting alternative archives such as archaeological artifacts, the architecture of mosques and houses as well as literary manuscripts.

This course examines the relationship between art, archaeology, and history in ancient Southeast Asia. This course spans the period from prehistory until 1600 which marks the approximate point when Southeast Asian polities and cultures began to change as a result of the forces of early colonialism. The course readings cover conventional themes in Southeast Asian ancient history. Topics include ?Indianization? (or Sanskritization as some scholars prefer to term it) in connection with Hindu and Buddhist concepts of kingship, processes of urbanization and state formation, networks of communications and trade, and their impact on the development of intellectual ideas, religious practices, art and architecture; and comparisons between the ideas of earlier Southeast Asian historians and new perspectives. This course will end with new data from the field by archaeologists and other scholars. There will also be discussions about whether the data support or refute established notions of the Southeast Asian past.

History of Global Capitalism introduces you to the discipline of economic history. Beginning with the rise of capitalism in the West, the module tracks the development of capitalism, its spread throughout the world, and the challenges it has faced. The module also introduces the major themes and debates in the new field of the history of capitalism, including the Industrial Revolution, the East-West divide, the entanglement of economics and geopolitics during the two world wars and the Cold War, and the increasingly important roles of gender and technology in our discussions on capitalism. We will also look at case studies of post-WWII America and China?s Economic Reforms starting from the late 1970s. This course also helps you to develop the skills to turn textual as well as numerical data into analytical historical writings. Through this course, you will become familiar with the different approaches to economic history and the methodological developments in the field, and learn what kinds of sources economic historians use and how they use them.

Many people, including historians of science in earlier ages, believed that science and religion are contraries. Science is often considered the paradigm of humans' rational thoughts that fight
against all kinds of ignorance, bigotry, and superstition, which may include religious thoughts and practices. However, many historians of science after the late twentieth century have found that the relationship between science and religion is far more complex. In some cases, religions do hamper and suppress some scientists' claims and activities, but religions can also be a positive factor in the construction of scientific ideas and worldviews, including those for the rise of modern science. This course aims at your deeper understanding of this complexity in a historical depth.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

This seminar covers major traditions of thought regarding climate, climate change and its impact on society, drawing on history, science and anthropology. In this course, you will investigate how climactic factors conditioned the development of human societies and conversely, how human societies impacted the climate. You will analyze diverse theories and interpretations of climate-related societal change that span a global scale while being embedded in their own local political, economic and social contexts. This course will also equip you to conceptualize the basic precepts and terminology that define knowledge of the climate while inviting you to critique this notion through empirical historical evidence. You will also develop your skills in analyzing environmental public policy and distinguish between data-supported arguments and popular rhetoric.  

This course will be useful for you if you seek to understand how human societies, past and present, have tackled, interpreted and responded to climate conditions. If you major in history or environmental studies, you will find the class useful in facilitating informed readings about the present climate crisis and in helping you analyze more deeply how policy-making, politics and societal change can make a difference to it. This will be of value for students aiming for careers in the public service sector or in journalism.

Firstly, this course will allow you to develop in-depth knowledge and critical perspectives on the Cultural Revolution as history by familiarizing you with secondary sources and debates on the period. Secondly, using various types of primary sources, including novels, exhibitions, films, and debates in online spaces, it seeks to develop historiographical skills by encouraging you to compare various source materials and perspectives, including sources categorized as 'fiction.' Finally, it also seeks to contribute to skills in the realm of public history by looking into how the Cultural Revolution has been remembered in public media. 

This course would not only allow you to develop your skills as historians through the use of sources across disciplines and beyond 'non-fiction,' but it would also help you to develop 'historical empathy' by reading personal accounts from multiple perspectives as well as written in different time periods.  No prior knowledge of Chinese history is required.

begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and
development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation
of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of
warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had
brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course
focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions
of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to
elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject
of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous
desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and
pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals,
particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction
of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several
millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have
lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at
the end of the course.

This course is about the history of Southeast Asia and the Cold War. It aims to enlighten
students on the origins and course of the conflict in the subregion in the global context.
It also seeks to help students appreciate the cultural, diplomatic, economic, political,
and social impacts of the twentieth century global conflict on Southeast Asia. In addition,
the course will analyze the effect that the turn of events in the area had on global and
international developments. To those ends, the course will pay particular attention to the
multidimensional attempts by external powers to expand their influence in Southeast
Asia as well as the ways that peoples within the area furthered their personal and
national ends by exploiting, adapting to, and resisting the Cold War powers` involvement
in their societies. By studying developments within twentieth century Southeast Asia
from global, international, transnational, and national perspectives, therefore, we will
discover that inasmuch as external forces had shaped the subregion, Southeast Asians
had also made significant impacts on the course of global and international history.

This module explores the `three-legged-stool? relationship between China, Hong Kong and Britain. It documents the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of modern China and British Hong Kong. It examines how changing politics and events in China influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony during the period from 1945 to 1997, and vice versa. 

Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong?s future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between China and British Hong Kong via seven inter-locking themes: changing Sino-British diplomatic relations, imperial diplomacy, colonial state-building, social order, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of China and British Hong Kong, useful insights in China?s development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired.

This course examines the important history of women and medicine in China by focusing on one of the most prominent areas: women's reproductive health. It discusses how a variety of actors conceptualized, discussed, constructed, or even contested Chinese women's reproductive health and bodies from the imperial period to the twentieth century. Employing a thematic rather than a chronological approach, this course covers a series of prominent themes related to women's reproduction, ranging from theorizations of the female reproductive body in classic works, to pragmatic and scientific practices in managing reproductive ailments such as menstruation, miscarriage, childbirth, and prenatal and postpartum care. This course also analyzes the important role that science and technology played in the development of women's reproductive health. Through a focused study on women's reproductive health in the Chinese context, this course aims to equip students with historical knowledge, critical thinking abilities, and analytical skills to reflect on issues about women, medicine, and science in other cultural and national contexts.
