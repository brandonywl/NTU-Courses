This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

This course is designed to situate art and artists in a number of diverse spiritual, geographical and historical contexts and in so doing allow you to explore art history through a variety of human beliefs. This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings? to our eyes; analyze what Jocho?s Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

This studio course provides an introduction to the techniques and processes of recording production sound with a focus on dialog for fiction and documentary film. The physics of sound and hearing will be examined in the context of the aesthetics of sound for images. Microphone types, functions and best practices for their use will be examined. Single and dual system audio recording techniques will be demonstrated. Students will learn how to prepare production audio for postproduction editing. An introduction to post production will include transfer formats from NLEs to Pro Tools and an introduction to dialog editing. This learning will form the basis for students to refine their use of sound in future media projects.

What is Sound?
Overview of the physics of sound and psychoacoustics. How we hear; frequency, amplitude, pitched and non-pitched sounds. Noise and types of noise. Listening to sound and developing a vocabulary to discuss it critically.

Microphones:
An investigation into the properties and operating principles of modern microphones. What the various types of microphone are and how we chose the best one for a particular application. Inverse square law, phase cancellation and proximity effect as related to the use of microphones.

Production Sound Recording:
Single and Dual system recording is explored in the context of recording dialog for fiction and non-fiction films. Location mixers, recorders, laviller and shotgun microphones will be examined and utilised in practical exercises. Correct protocols and techniques for on set dialog recording will investigated with a consideration of the aesthetics of dialog recording. Critical listening to identify and correct sound recording errors will be developed.

Post Production:
Delivering production sound to the editor including correct sound coverage and a complete sound report will be explored. Synchronising sound and image in picture editing software and exporting  sound and image from this software using the correct output formats. Basics of editing sound in audio editing software with an emphasis on understanding how production recording influences post production sound editing. Post production processing techniques including noise reduction, compression and EQ will be introduced and examined.

Class assignments:
There are four in class dialog recording assignments that explore various shooting scenarios and recording systems. The final 2 assignments include a dialogue editing component. There will also be 2 in class quizzes covering more theoretical aspects of sound, sound recording and post production.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.
