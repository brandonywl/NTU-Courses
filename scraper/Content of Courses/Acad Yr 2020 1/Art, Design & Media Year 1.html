This course introduces you to the practice and theory of writing narratives for creative media. Narratives, the principles of storytelling, play a crucial part in much of the media and design landscape, and writing is a key tool for their construction. Narrative writing has to engage with the materiality of the media and is in a creative dialogue with form and content. During this course you will engage with and analyse notable examples, forms, techniques and ideas around narrative and storytelling, and you will begin to develop your own writing practice through a series of practical projects with the instructor and peer feedback.
