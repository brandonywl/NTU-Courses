This course introduces students to the uniqueness of human language as a communication system. Students will examine how language is learnt and the way our mind stores meaning and organises information. The topics include animal communication, biological foundation of human language, language acquisition, sign language and deaf studies, language impairment, word formation and the study of meaning. These concepts are illustrated by examples taken from a wide range of languages. These topics will be discussed with cross?linguistic and interdisciplinary perspectives, as students will analyze data from a wide variety of languages and explore contributions from psychology, sociology, computer science and communication studies.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

Traditionally linguistic analysis was done largely by hand, but computer-based methods and tools are becoming increasingly more widely used in contemporary research. This course provides an introduction to the key instruments and resources available on the personal computer that can assist the linguist in performing fast, flexible and accurate quantitative analyses. Students will learn a scripting language (Python) and use it and the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) to analyse linguistic phenomena. The following topics will be covered in detail:
	File input/output
	Control Structures
	Frequency Distributions
	Regular Expressions
	Access to lexical resources
	Classification

The course introduces fundamental topics in History of Cryptography and Language Decipherment. It would consist of a basic introduction to classical Cryptography, from the origins (Antiquity, in the West and in the East) to the Second World War, aimed essentially at providing the students a general and accurate overview about Cryptography as a science and cultural phenomenon, dealing with the history of this discipline and encryption and decryption methods developed over time by Cryptographers. 
The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of combinatorial analysis and encryption techniques. Moreover, the course would have a focus on deciphering techniques applied not only to cryptographic systems, but also to ancient undeciphered languages and writing systems.  

A particular attention will be given to the study of the History of Cryptography and of the developments of this discipline, in the West and in the East, over time. The course will introduce, therefore, the study of Cryptography in a historical and theoretical way, analyzing the general and original principles of this science, but also dealing with the direct application of those principles (with the support of practical models useful to directly experiment encryption and deciphering techniques). 

The topic will be approached in a very general and all-embracing way, starting from the basic principles and from the origins of Cryptography and broadening the analysis to the contribution of Cryptography to the scientific progress of communications, security systems, and computer sciences.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

In this course, you will be provided with the necessary knowledge in using statistical tools for your own research project, such as t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression etc.  You will not be tested on formulae, instead, the focus is on how to make use of computer software, such as Excel and SPSS, to organise data, present observation and conduct statistical analysis.  You will also gain experience on how to write up empirical findings in a language acceptable by the field and learn to critically read statistics reported in prescribed readings from other courses.  Through this problem-based approach you will gain a deeper understanding of statistics.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

The course begins with an overview of natural language processing (NLP) to situate speech synthesis and recognition within industry and reviews familiar applications of these systems. Necessary topics concerning phonetics and phonology are introduced/reviewed, with a particular focus on acoustic phonetics. The topic of speech synthesis is then covered, with a focus on concatenative synthesis and statistical parametric systems, but formant-based and articulatory synthesis will also be covered in detail. In relation to these latter topics, students will learn about modeling the structures of the vocal tract to produce articulatory-based systems and the types of applications these have in speech research. Next the topic of speech recognition is covered. Students will learn about the design parameters of these systems and the tie-ins with other topics in NLP (such as language models and syntactic and semantic parsers). The Hidden Markov Model will be discussed in detail and its application to the task of recognizing speech in conjunction with acoustic analysis and modeling of the speech signal.

In this course we will examine how language is represented and learnt in the brain.  Cutting-edge findings from state of the art techniques using functional neuroimaging and lesion studies will be reviewed to enable students to understand the workings of the human brain in relation to language use. Specific aspects of language processing such as meaning representation, speech perception and learning, learning disabilities as well as the bilingual brain will be introduced. Basic neuroanatomy will also be covered to enable students to pursue further studies. This course introduces functional neuroimaging at an advanced level.

The course will focus on critical topics that affect multilingual individuals in multilingual communities across the lifespan. The approach is interdisciplinary as the readings will be drawn from psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and education. The students will read advanced theoretical discussion of multilingualism as a phenomenon and reflect on why the current research scope needs to be extended to include multilinguals and not just bilinguals. The primary focus of the course is on evaluating how multilingualism alters our perception of the world from a cognitive perspective. However, the importance of social contexts and its modulating impact on cognition will be a central theme in this course. The readings will also be geared towards an in depth understanding of the methodological concerns in the field.. 

At the end of the course, students will be more able to ask incisive questions relevant to the field and develop a topic for research. Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to pursue their own data collection for their own independent research in a multilingual context.

In this course, you will learn to analyse talk and its relations to multimodal resources for communication. In particular, you will learn how the speaker's action is projected through 
cooperative bodily gestures, thereby learning an integrative approach to the organization of 
language, the body, and the physical environment, all in the context of situated human interaction. 
Therefore, you will analyse the body, not as an isolated entity, but instead as a visible agent whose 
talk and action are lodged within both processes of human interaction, and the rich settings where 
people pursue the courses of action that constitute their social lives through talk-in-interaction.

Theories of grammar can be divided into structural, formal and functional models. Taking a selection of grammatical categories - such as relative clauses, passive, case, subject, non-configurational syntax etc. (these may change from year to year depending upon the coordinator) - we will compare how effective each theoretical model of syntax is in accounting for the same sets of linguistic data. The topics for investigation will be determined in the first seminar in consultation with students; these will then be considered from the perspective of (i) classical structuralism, (ii) generative theories including Government and Binding, Lexical Functional grammar, and Head-driven Phrase structure Grammar, and finally (iii) Functional-Typological theories such as Role and Reference Grammar and usage-based models such as Radical Construction Grammar.

This course begins with an introduction to an empirical approach to language description and comparison frorn a cognitive perspective, plus introduction to information structure concepts, which fundamental to understanding language structure. A range of linguistic forms and functions are then compared and contrasted systematically at different levels of analysis, attempting to highlight the cognitive differences in the mindsets of the speakers (how they cut up or "chunk" their experiences and represent them in language forms) that lead to the languages manifesting different patterns.

In this unit we focus on how we understand what someone is trying to communicate to us when they say or write something to us, especially how the particular words and structures are used for the purpose of getting us to understand just what the speaker intends. Given that the meaning of a word or structure depends on how it is used, we will look at the physical and cultural contexts within which communication occurs and develop an understanding of the role they play in the communication of meaning.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

Speech synthesis and recognition deals with the design and implementation of computer systems that can 'produce' and 'perceive' speech signals. The goal of this course is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand, evaluate, and design and implement a wide range of speech synthesis and recognition systems. These two fields are highly relevant in the linguistics-related sector of the information and communications technology industry. Taking this course will open up opportunities for you by preparing you to enter positions related to these topics or pursue advanced degrees dealing with speech synthesis and/or recognition. For those of you who are more interested in linguistics research, the course will have positive benefits for the study phonetics and phonology, since many of the topics discussed reinforce and extend issues in these fields, particularly concerning acoustic phonetics.

The course will cover three main areas: experimental design, acoustic methods, perceptual methods. It is necessary to fully understand the tools and techniques used to properly implement experiments and to interpret the resulting data. Emphasis is placed on the design of phonetic and phonological experiments using electronic systems and introducing computer technology for speech analysis. Therefore, in addition to the sections on experimental methodology there will be a significant portion of the course devoted to mastering computer-based acoustic analysis.
