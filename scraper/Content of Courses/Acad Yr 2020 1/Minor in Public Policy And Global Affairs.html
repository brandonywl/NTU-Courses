This course examines major texts and thinkers in the Western history of political thought and the questions they raise about political order and authority. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. We will study political thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Tocqueville. It considers the ways in which thinkers have responded to the particular political problems of their day, and the ways in which they contribute to a broader understanding about human goods and needs, justice, and democracy, and how they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. The aim of this course is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various thinkers and their philosophical approaches in order to gain a critical perspective on our own.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students who have never been exposed to political science studies to the fundamentals of the discipline. In so doing, students in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme (major & minor) will acquire the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical tools that would allow them to think seriously about politics. The ultimate goal is to equip students with essential political ideas and principles and enable them to apply these concepts to studying contemporary political life.

This course introduces students to the politics of migration in a globalised era. The perspectives of migrant inclusion and exclusion will be used to help students acquire a deeper understanding of the political, economic and social functions of borders; how states regulate migrants' access to citizenship; the role of security in migration regulation; the competing sets of political, economic and social demands states must satisfy in regulating migration; and how different categories of migrants are politically, economically and socially constructed. Students will be required to analyze and synthesize the above knowledge and articulate them in a cogent and accessible way, both orally and in writing.

'The Asian Century' is the buzz word that many pundits and experts use in describing East Asia in the 21st Century. Given the rapid economic development in the region, propelled by China and the Southeast Asian states with the United States, Japan, and South Korea as the established economies, Asia has a great potential to lead the world economies. However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.'
This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism. We will discuss the concept of 'East Asia' and ?International Security; history of East Asian security; US 'hub-and-spoke' system, particularly the US-Japan alliance; ASEAN multilateralism, particularly ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and East Asia Summit; advanced theoretical frameworks to make sense of East Asian security; and regional security issues, such as the Rise of China, the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, East and South China Sea. In order to foster discussions in the class, students need to catch up with contemporary East Asian affairs, through Newspaper, Magazines, and on-line media. By the end of this class, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in East Asia and be able to use international relations theory to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to resolve them.

This seminar aims to offer students the in-depth, comprehensive knowledge and analyses of potentials, strengths, and limitations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through class discussions, students will learn history, characteristics, and functions of ASEAN from the material and ideational perspectives. With these knowledge, students will gain an ability to analyze the ASEAN?s utility (potentials and limitations) and raison d'etre by employing not only International Relations (IR) theories, but also theories in other fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, history). Those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations and Asian/Southeast Asian studies or career in foreign affairs and international relations should take this course, since this becomes a rigid intellectual foundation of ASEAN studies.

It is no longer news that more than half of the world's population are living in urban areas and by 2050, 66 percent of the world will be according to United Nations' projection. Cities are growing in size and in presence! Literature about cities and urbanism proliferates as new fads of urbanism ebb and flow. With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment.

This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research.  The course content is deliberately multi-disciplinary, reflecting the rich and vast interest in the planning and development of cities. 

This course is for students who are keen to further engage in a critical inquiry of cities and discussing about what a good city is, beyond the basic content offered in HU1002: Introduction to Urban Planning and HU2002: Urban Life and Urban Planning. The course is crafted with the aim to allow students to co-produce and co-own the course content that they find valuable in informing their interests about the subject matter, and their graduation research projects.

This course will introduce you to the politics and policies of food in several countries, international organisations, and across time. Food is fundamentally essential to our physical existence, but it is also intensely cultural, with socially constructed behaviour and preferences that are change-resistant even in the presence of new knowledge, policies, and practices. How have different historical, social, economic, political, and institutional factors contributed to shaping national and international food policy outcomes? In this course, we begin with a heuristic analytical framework that enables you to study how interests, ideas, instruments, and institutions interact and affect the formation, development, and implementation of national and international food policy decisions. This course is organised around four themes: politics of food identity; globalisation or glocalisation; politics of food scandals; and international politics of food. By taking this course, you will learn how food is a powerful lens to understand contemporary politics and policies beyond consumption and nutrition.
