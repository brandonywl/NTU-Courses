While ET9134 let students experience the process of creating and managing a business in the virtual environment, in this module, students are required to launch an actual business.  

This module allows students to experience the critical role of opportunity creation & recognition, and to practice the method of evaluating new venture concepts.  Essentially this course integrates what students have learned in earlier parts of the Entrepreneurship Minor.  Throughout this module, students will be exposed to the many 'ups and downs' that starting and operating a new business venture and / or an under-performing or `turn-around company' entails.
