This course analyses ideas about gender and sexuality in the modern world, as well as the experiences of modern men and women.  In this course, we rethink modern categorisations of gender and sexuality.  Students will deconstruct dual gender systems through analysing diverse gender roles and multiple genders in different parts of the world.  We will analyse how gender has intersected with various dimensions of modernity, including: class and domesticity; labour; imperialism and race; citizenship and nationalism; sexuality and the body; ideas about crime; and forms of popular culture and mass media.  Students will gain an understanding of how contemporary ideas about gender and sexuality are historically specific.

In this course, you will examine and deconstruct the category 'Malay' as a lens into the broader processes of making and unmaking group identities in the maritime Southeast Asia region that historically used the Malay language as a trade lingua franca. You will conceptualize how Malay ethnic identity is an ongoing process and group boundaries develop with culturally specific markers along five major axes: economy, geography, political authority, religion and gender. As the course spans the pre-modern and modern periods, it will offer you an opportunity to compare and contrast how these processes change over time. Given the paucity of conventional documentary archives in accessing this history, you will develop new skills in interpreting alternative archives such as archaeological artifacts, the architecture of mosques and houses as well as literary manuscripts.

This course examines the relationship between art, archaeology, and history in ancient Southeast Asia. This course spans the period from prehistory until 1600 which marks the approximate point when Southeast Asian polities and cultures began to change as a result of the forces of early colonialism. The course readings cover conventional themes in Southeast Asian ancient history. Topics include ?Indianization? (or Sanskritization as some scholars prefer to term it) in connection with Hindu and Buddhist concepts of kingship, processes of urbanization and state formation, networks of communications and trade, and their impact on the development of intellectual ideas, religious practices, art and architecture; and comparisons between the ideas of earlier Southeast Asian historians and new perspectives. This course will end with new data from the field by archaeologists and other scholars. There will also be discussions about whether the data support or refute established notions of the Southeast Asian past.

History of Global Capitalism introduces you to the discipline of economic history. Beginning with the rise of capitalism in the West, the module tracks the development of capitalism, its spread throughout the world, and the challenges it has faced. The module also introduces the major themes and debates in the new field of the history of capitalism, including the Industrial Revolution, the East-West divide, the entanglement of economics and geopolitics during the two world wars and the Cold War, and the increasingly important roles of gender and technology in our discussions on capitalism. We will also look at case studies of post-WWII America and China?s Economic Reforms starting from the late 1970s. This course also helps you to develop the skills to turn textual as well as numerical data into analytical historical writings. Through this course, you will become familiar with the different approaches to economic history and the methodological developments in the field, and learn what kinds of sources economic historians use and how they use them.

Many people, including historians of science in earlier ages, believed that science and religion are contraries. Science is often considered the paradigm of humans' rational thoughts that fight
against all kinds of ignorance, bigotry, and superstition, which may include religious thoughts and practices. However, many historians of science after the late twentieth century have found that the relationship between science and religion is far more complex. In some cases, religions do hamper and suppress some scientists' claims and activities, but religions can also be a positive factor in the construction of scientific ideas and worldviews, including those for the rise of modern science. This course aims at your deeper understanding of this complexity in a historical depth.

This course shall examine the history of Maritime Asia in the longue duree.  It shall explore the roles of the seas and oceans in shaping the region?s history, away from the older models of land-bound nation-states.  In doing so, it focuses on the mobilities of people, ideas, and commodities across these spaces.  It shall examine different dimensions of Maritime Asia, from trade, business, and the economic infrastructures, to the social communities living and moving in these spaces and obtaining their livelihoods from them, cultural and religious systems and networks, political systems of governance, the environmental issues connected to the seas and maritime spaces, and the technologies and sciences associated with the traversing of such spaces. It also adopts a diachronic perspective tracing the transformations of Maritime Asia from the pre-modern to the early modern and the modern periods of Asian history, from the connecting of the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asian and East Asian seas to the Atlantic and the Pacific.  Even as the centers of political power and the world-system shifted between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, Maritime Asia continued to be the fulcrum of this global system.  Looking at Asia from the perspective of the seas and oceans, as well as the littorals and islands that they connect, highlights the importance of mobility as well as the cross-cultural encounters and cosmopolitan environments that they engender, To understand these dynamics and structures, an interdisciplinary approach will be crucial, bringing together environment, technology, logistics, urban studies, piracy, and governance   the advent of air travel and transport, the oceans continue to be the most important spaces for the movement of goods and people, driving the global and Asian economies.

This seminar covers major traditions of thought regarding climate, climate change and its impact on society, drawing on history, science and anthropology. In this course, you will investigate how climactic factors conditioned the development of human societies and conversely, how human societies impacted the climate. You will analyze diverse theories and interpretations of climate-related societal change that span a global scale while being embedded in their own local political, economic and social contexts. This course will also equip you to conceptualize the basic precepts and terminology that define knowledge of the climate while inviting you to critique this notion through empirical historical evidence. You will also develop your skills in analyzing environmental public policy and distinguish between data-supported arguments and popular rhetoric.  

This course will be useful for you if you seek to understand how human societies, past and present, have tackled, interpreted and responded to climate conditions. If you major in history or environmental studies, you will find the class useful in facilitating informed readings about the present climate crisis and in helping you analyze more deeply how policy-making, politics and societal change can make a difference to it. This will be of value for students aiming for careers in the public service sector or in journalism.

Firstly, this course will allow you to develop in-depth knowledge and critical perspectives on the Cultural Revolution as history by familiarizing you with secondary sources and debates on the period. Secondly, using various types of primary sources, including novels, exhibitions, films, and debates in online spaces, it seeks to develop historiographical skills by encouraging you to compare various source materials and perspectives, including sources categorized as 'fiction.' Finally, it also seeks to contribute to skills in the realm of public history by looking into how the Cultural Revolution has been remembered in public media. 

This course would not only allow you to develop your skills as historians through the use of sources across disciplines and beyond 'non-fiction,' but it would also help you to develop 'historical empathy' by reading personal accounts from multiple perspectives as well as written in different time periods.  No prior knowledge of Chinese history is required.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. You will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage you to critically evaluate  and  write about  issues  from  multiple  perspectives  before you develop your  own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as you go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus.
