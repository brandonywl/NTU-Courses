This course introduces students to the politics of migration in a globalised era. The perspectives of migrant inclusion and exclusion will be used to help students acquire a deeper understanding of the political, economic and social functions of borders; how states regulate migrants' access to citizenship; the role of security in migration regulation; the competing sets of political, economic and social demands states must satisfy in regulating migration; and how different categories of migrants are politically, economically and socially constructed. Students will be required to analyze and synthesize the above knowledge and articulate them in a cogent and accessible way, both orally and in writing.

'The Asian Century' is the buzz word that many pundits and experts use in describing East Asia in the 21st Century. Given the rapid economic development in the region, propelled by China and the Southeast Asian states with the United States, Japan, and South Korea as the established economies, Asia has a great potential to lead the world economies. However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.'
This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism. We will discuss the concept of 'East Asia' and ?International Security; history of East Asian security; US 'hub-and-spoke' system, particularly the US-Japan alliance; ASEAN multilateralism, particularly ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and East Asia Summit; advanced theoretical frameworks to make sense of East Asian security; and regional security issues, such as the Rise of China, the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, East and South China Sea. In order to foster discussions in the class, students need to catch up with contemporary East Asian affairs, through Newspaper, Magazines, and on-line media. By the end of this class, you should have a more nuanced understanding of security threats in East Asia and be able to use international relations theory to explain why certain issues become threats and how political actors have sought to resolve them.

This seminar aims to offer students the in-depth, comprehensive knowledge and analyses of potentials, strengths, and limitations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through class discussions, students will learn history, characteristics, and functions of ASEAN from the material and ideational perspectives. With these knowledge, students will gain an ability to analyze the ASEAN?s utility (potentials and limitations) and raison d'etre by employing not only International Relations (IR) theories, but also theories in other fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, history). Those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations and Asian/Southeast Asian studies or career in foreign affairs and international relations should take this course, since this becomes a rigid intellectual foundation of ASEAN studies.

It is no longer news that more than half of the world's population are living in urban areas and by 2050, 66 percent of the world will be according to United Nations' projection. Cities are growing in size and in presence! Literature about cities and urbanism proliferates as new fads of urbanism ebb and flow. With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment.

This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research.  The course content is deliberately multi-disciplinary, reflecting the rich and vast interest in the planning and development of cities. 

This course is for students who are keen to further engage in a critical inquiry of cities and discussing about what a good city is, beyond the basic content offered in HU1002: Introduction to Urban Planning and HU2002: Urban Life and Urban Planning. The course is crafted with the aim to allow students to co-produce and co-own the course content that they find valuable in informing their interests about the subject matter, and their graduation research projects.

This course will introduce you to the politics and policies of food in several countries, international organisations, and across time. Food is fundamentally essential to our physical existence, but it is also intensely cultural, with socially constructed behaviour and preferences that are change-resistant even in the presence of new knowledge, policies, and practices. How have different historical, social, economic, political, and institutional factors contributed to shaping national and international food policy outcomes? In this course, we begin with a heuristic analytical framework that enables you to study how interests, ideas, instruments, and institutions interact and affect the formation, development, and implementation of national and international food policy decisions. This course is organised around four themes: politics of food identity; globalisation or glocalisation; politics of food scandals; and international politics of food. By taking this course, you will learn how food is a powerful lens to understand contemporary politics and policies beyond consumption and nutrition.

This module covers the fundamental notions of cost-benefit analysis;  a method of evaluating the relative merits of alternative public investment projects or programmes in order to achieve economic efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources.  In a way, cost-benefit analysis identifies and assesses the factors which need to be considered in making rational economic choices.  In addition to understanding the theory and applying the principles behind cost-benefit analysis, some further complementary techniques drawn from decision sciences will be taught.  The welfare foundations of cost-benefit analysis will be emphasized throughout the module.  Topics covered will include identification and measurement of benefits and costs; investment decision criteria; risk and uncertainty; problems of distribution and equity; and particular problems in project evaluation.

This course studies urban spaces from an economist's perspective. Why do cities exist, and what are the benefits - and costs - of organizing economic and social activity in close proximity? Students taking this course will apply intermediate microeconomic theory and micro-econometrics to the analysis of cities and urban problems. Students will also be expected to understand and interpret contemporary empirical economic research into urban problems. Fundamental contributions from other social sciences and disciplines to the study of urban economic activity will also be discussed.

In line with the course's objectives, students will be assessed based on a group project based on the interpretation of existing contemporary research; an individual research paper; and a final examination testing knowledge and application of theory and concepts

In this course, we adopt the overlapping-generations model as the dynamic model to model the macro economy, and use a consistent approach based on microeconomic foundations and the rationality of economic agents to address several issues in monetary policy, exchange-rate policy and fiscal policy. Among other issues, the issues in monetary policy studied here include the welfare effects of an increasing stock of fiat money, the development of financial intermediaries in the presence of differences in the rates of return between illiquid capital and money, and the reasons for the observed correlation between the nominal money stock and real output. The issues in exchange-rate policy studied here include the implications of different international monetary systems, the determination of exchange rates in the presence of currency controls and the indeterminacy of exchange rates when people are free to hold currencies of their choice.

Personnel Economics is the application of economic and mathematical approaches and econometric and statistical methods to traditional topics in the study of human resources management. Compared to the standard labor economics courses, this course focuses more on the internal labor market within firms. This includes topics such as compensation, turnover, incentives, and compensation that are inherently economic, as well as those that do not at first appear to be economic topics, such as norms, teamwork, worker empowerment, and peer relationships. It has become a rapid developing research field since its birth and, as a course, has been taught in many top universities and MBA programs. The current course is a general introduction to this emerging field of researches and the human resource management in practice. We analyze the efficient allocation and motivation of employees as well as their development of skills within a company. We discuss recruiting mechanisms, training strategies and efficient compensation schemes. The course also has a focus on recent empirical evidences within the field of personnel economics.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.
