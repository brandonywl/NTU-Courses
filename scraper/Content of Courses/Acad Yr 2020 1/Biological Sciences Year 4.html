This 13-week programme provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in the development and regulation of healthcare products. The main area of concentration is in medical devices and is divided into four parts. The course begins with a historical introduction into the healthcare products industry and the start of regulatory controls. It then moves into the core principles of healthcare products regulations and expands into the methodologies of ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes going through the fundamentals of Good Manufacturing Practices, quality management systems, product risk classification, risk management and the different regulatory systems in the world. At the end of this course, you should have a clear understanding of healthcare products regulations and able to apply these requirements in product development. You will also be required to perform casework to test their ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios.

In this course, you will develop a fundamental understanding and will become conversant in the applications of several critical spectroscopy techniques to Structural Biology. Mainly through X-ray diffraction of crystals (XRD), but also Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Microscopy (EM), the atomic view of the biological world is continuously expanding. Although this solves many mysteries of molecular function, our understanding of structure and function often requires the use of other complementary techniques, especially those that rely on the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological molecules, i.e., spectroscopy. These spectroscopic methods provide essential insights that are not accessible by the main structural techniques (XRD, NMR or EM), in the structural analysis of biomolecules, their dynamics, protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, or the role of these biomolecules in a cellular environment. Overall, the aim is that you can use the acquired understanding of these techniques and apply it to a series of problems with examples from the literature, understanding at the same time their limitations, for their integration in your future projects. Current practice of Structural Biology is critically dependent on such integration. From a professional perspective, each of these techniques is a world in itself, and familiarity with its applications will also be useful in your future potential links with industry.

In this workshop, students will study the genetics of aging and longevity using various long-lived and short-lived worms carrying mutations of genes in the first life-extension pathway discovered in C. elegans. They will learn how the rate of aging is regulated hormonally by insulin and IGF-1 endocrine systems. Further, students will learn about the importance of protein homeostasis in aging and neurodegeneration using a worm model for polyglutamine (polyQ) disease. Students will perform assays for determining lifespan, motility, stress resistance, protein aggregation phenotype and toxicity using different biochemical, cell biology and imaging (light and fluorescent microscopy) experimental techniques. In line with Technology-Enabled Learning (TEL), the course will develop a series of video lessons or App to cover the seminars and lab experimental preview and setup for online learning. There is also plan for developing an online interactive platform to facilitate team-based learning amongst the students.

The aim of this one-week intensive course is to provide a hands-on approach to practical modern biological macromolecular crystallography. Briefings or introduction of the concepts and techniques related to the practical of the day will be followed by practical classes at the bench or in the computer lab. 
The intended audience is composed of undergraduates who want to use crystallographic methods during the course of their projects and/or students in the field of macromolecular crystallography, especially for 2nd major in Biomedical Structural Biology students.
Students will work in teams to solve case studies during the class and during assignments. The course also aims to foster critical examination of research papers presenting crystal structures. This course is designed for biology undergraduates in later half of their study and to further study in the related field.

This 4th year elective course aims to help you gain an advanced level of understanding of the comprehensive components of plant biotechnology, the discipline that is making growing contributions to food security, human and animal health and sustainable environment but often surrounded by misunderstanding, criticism and safety concerns. On top of technical insights into plant breeding, tissue culture, plant genes and genetic modification (GM), you will have the overview of GM plants in the market and pipeline and their various applications like food and medicine. You will also gain a good knowledge on global regulation framework on GM plant and product as well as intellectual property rights related to plant biotechnology. The course will help your careers in plant related research, government regulatory bodies, education, food industry and other plant product and related businesses.

High throughput sequencing has made it possible to quantify the genomes and transcriptomes of any species. Transcriptome sequencing can produce evidence about molecular responses to environmental stimuli, whereas genome sequencing is used to study the evolution and adaptation in the particular species. In this course you will develop skills to process and analyze both genome and transcriptome sequencing data from most common sequencing platforms and to carry out data analysis in species with or without a reference genome. Practical analysis is done using free and open-source software tools with an emphasis on the command-line Linux computing environment.

Microbial communities are the life support system of our biosphere. Microorganisms date back to the origin of life on Earth and they will likely exist well beyond any future extinction events. They can be found in every environment on Earth that is occupied by macroscopic organisms and are the unique life forms in `extreme? environments (e.g. deep sea vents, earth interior). This is an introductory course that will explore how microbes play key roles in and support the complex ecosystems we find in our biosphere. Through the lectures and lab tutorials, Microbes on natural ecosystems will provide you with background knowledge on fundamentals of microbiology, origin and diversity of microbial world, common methods to study microbes in their environment, how microorganisms control the chemistry of Earth, how microorganisms affect and will be affected by global climate change and how conservation biologists and microbial scientists can work together to preserve our biosphere. By the end of this course, you will appreciate and understand the importance of microbial processes to maintain a healthy global ecosystem. This course will be also open to graduate students who wish to improve and/or overview their knowledge on microbiology and microbial ecology.
