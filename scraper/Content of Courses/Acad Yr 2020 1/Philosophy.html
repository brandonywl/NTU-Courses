What's proper reasoning and how do you tell whether an argument is good or bad? This class introduces you to formal logic, a set of powerful tools that allow us to give precise answers to the preceding questions. Along the way we will also discuss a few paradoxes - for example, how should we understand and evaluate claims about objects that don't exist, such as the claim that Santa Clause lives on the North Pole?

This course offers an overview of central arguments and debates in early modern philosophy. We will examine different responses to what is arguably the central epistemological question of the period: is knowledge based on reason or on experience? By working through the answers to this question given by Descartes, Hume, Leibniz, and Kant, we will better understand key commitments of the Rationalist and Empiricist philosophical traditions, and get a sense of how Kant attempts to transform the terms of the debate. We will also have the opportunity to cultivate analytical and critical skills that will help us better understand the arguments of early-modern philosophers and their relevance today. The course will feature extensive textual and argument analysis.

'Friendship' introduces the nature of friendship through different historical thinkers as well as contemporary theories. The course challenges students to think about the necessary components of a friendship and the importance of friendship in becoming an ethical person. Particular emphasis will be placed on analyzing arguments from the original text, constructing and evaluating strengths of relevant objections. Students will develop highlevel critical thinking and writing skills by examining historical text and contemporary writing. Students will bechallenged to think about ?friendship? as a philosophical issue but draw practical significance from studying it.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of technology. Technology affects almost every aspect of our lives, and it has rich philosophical implications that have been explored by philosophers going back to Plato and Aristotle. Its increasing significance in the twentieth century led to the development of various theories about technology and its significance. This course explores epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical issues surrounding technology and engineering. Some questions considered include: How does technology change what it means to be human? What is technological or engineering knowledge, and how does it differ from scientific and other kinds of knowledge? What kinds of ethical problems arise due to the development of technology?

Consequentialism holds, roughly, that acts are permissible if and only if they bring about the best outcome. The right-to-left reading of this biconditional is a particularly compelling idea. Since by our acts we influence how things turn out, it's hard to deny that it is always permissible to actualize the outcome that's best. And yet critics have leveled a number of powerful objections. It is argued that the theory's commitment to aggregation is objectionable, that it fails to recognize the separateness of persons, that it disregards the moral importance of integrity, that it's overly stringent (or excessively permissive), and that it falters in the face of collective action problems. Beyond these external criticisms, the precise formulation of the theory presents a number of technical obstacles. This has given rise to major internal disputes among its advocates. Should we, for example, bring about the most actual good or aim for the
most expected good? Are our obligations determined by the possible consequences of our acts
or their actual consequences? This course will address the three issues just mention: Consequentialism's compellingness, and its purported internal and external problems.

This course is suitable for those who want to investigate the nature of consequentialism in a philosophically rigorous manner.

By the end of the course, you'll have a sense of the complexities involved in working out a consequentialist theory.

Phenomenology is one of the most important and enduring philosophical traditions of the last two hundred years. In this course, we will study its historical development and systematic
contributions to key philosophical issues, including the intentional structure of human consciousness; the relation between linguistic meaning and thought; the origins and justification of knowledge; the nature of evidence; the significance of everyday experience (including death and anxiety) for truth, knowledge, and action; the possibility of a phenomenological ethics; the philosophical importance of intersubjectivity, and others.

The course studies the various answers that phenomenologists have given to these and other questions, starting from the work of Edmund Husserl,the founder of phenomenology. We will then consider responses to Husserl's work from his students, including Edith Stein and Martin
Heidegger, before turning to the development of phenomenology in France in the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Luc Marion.

Effective altruism (EA) is a philosophical and social movement guided by the simple yet powerful idea that we should use our resources (money, time, etc.) to do the most good that we can.  This course explores a variety of theoretical and practical issues surrounding EA, including its philosophical foundations, its application to major choices we make in our lives, and notable criticisms that it faces.  Examples of more specific topics we?ll cover include how morally demanding EA should be, whether EA is compatible with moral frameworks other than utilitarianism, and criticisms (and possible improvements) of its conception of effective intervention.

This course aims to teach you to think logically and critically. It covers a broad range of logical concepts and terminology, including argument, premise, conclusion, inductive and deductive reasoning, validity, soundness, and strength. You will learn how to evaluate good deductive arguments through the study of categorical and truth functional logic, and good inductive arguments using a probabilistic framework.
Finally, you will learn about common fallacies (rhetorical, statistical, and psychological), how to avoid them, and how to clearly communicate where fallacious arguments go wrong.
