This course introduces you to classical, modern and contemporary Chinese ecological thoughts - from traditional Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist thoughts on nature and ecology, to the emergence of ecocriticism and eco-aesthetics as new academic disciplines in contemporary China. Focusing on the historical and cultural significance of concepts that are related to nature and ecology, such as Chinese solar terms, shanshui (natural landscapes), and animals; as well as the increasing dialogues and clashes between Chinese and Western ecological thoughts, this course stimulates you to reflect upon the intricate and complex relationships between human beings and the natural world. At a time of many global environmental crises and challenges, this course also encourages you to contemplate how ancient and contemporary ecological thoughts and theories can both be put into daily-life practices, as well as to cultivate our spiritual wellbeing and make changes to the world.

This course is intended for students interested in the meanings of being a Chinese overseas in a rapidly changing world. It investigates the changing relations Chinese overseas have with China and the factors underlying these changes. It first looks at Overseas Chinese's concern about China's political upheaval and social disorder before 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded. It then examines the isolation of Chinese overseas from China between 1949 and 1978, because of the radical political movements in China and nation-building projects in their countries of residence. It subsequently explores the responses of Chinese overseas after 1978 when China launched economic reform. This course provides you with the necessary knowledge for future courses in HC4060 and HC4061.

This course traces the literary and cultural history of modern China from the May Fourth Movement, the surge of revolutionary literature in the late 1920s, the formation and development of Maoist aesthetics under the socialist regime, to the reflection on revolution in the post-Mao era. We will end the course with contemporary engagements with the idea of revolution by looking at some realist literature from Taiwan, documentary films from Hong Kong, and the suppressed articulations of dissent in mainland China. The themes of art and revolution provide a specific perspective to revisit modern Chinese literary history. They highlight the political urgencies behind the renovation of national culture in the beginning of the twentieth century, and reveal how such imperatives continued to shape the changing contour of Chinese literature and culture throughout this long century. The focus on art and revolution also allow us to look beyond revolution in its most straightforward political sense, and attend to the revolution of gender norms and cultural forms that were equally important in modern Chinese history. We will pay attention to this multifaceted idea of revolutionary in our textual analyses of literary and artistic works. The texts covered in this course ranges from literature, film, documentary, the visual arts, as well as theoretical and discursive documents. We will also address different genres of literature such as fiction, drama, and poetry.
