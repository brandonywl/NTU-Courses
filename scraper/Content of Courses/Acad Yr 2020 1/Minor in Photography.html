Introduction:
You will be introduced to the fundamentals of photography ? composition, form, perspective, distance, focal length. Discussion will also cover the camera, and the essential components that make photography ? framing, exposure, depth of field and film speed. This is followed by a discussion about how these elements are used by the creative photographer to influence content.

Processing;
You will learn about the various technical processes of developing and printing. This includes knowing the correct procedures when handling photographic chemicals.

Darkroom:
The darkroom section covers the technical processes of printing an image as well as the creative process of using light to reveal the image in a creative manner. Many techniques will be covered that dictate how the final images appear, such as exposure, contrast, dodging, burning, and toning.

Developing a personal body of work: 
Throughout this course will record and archive your work. This includes recording notes pertaining to techniques and photographic observations.

Self-expression:
In this course you will also be exposed to concepts of self-expression through photography. You will discuss, evaluate, and reflect on your own work, and the work of others, in a critical, supportive workshop studio environment.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

This open elective course will provide an overview of the evolution of the photographic medium over two hundred years from earliest invention to contemporary innovations. In this course you will examine the emergence of photographic traditions and practices within the context of artistic, cultural, social, scientific, and philosophical forces that shaped particular directions in the medium?s development. This course highlights the development of photography as the first media art and is highly relevant to students pursuing the Photographic  pathway in Media Arts.

In this intermediate-level course you will explore the creative space that lies between image, sequenced image, motion-graphic, and video. Using the image as a starting point, you will explore how time-based processes can add extra dimensions to your visual explorations. You will expand imagery into time-based artistic formats and produce video art installations that can be presented in an exhibition context. You will also gain a basic understanding of genres and forms of Video Art and other artist's moving image work within contemporary art and wider media practice.
