Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

This course introduces students to the different genres of contemporary popular global cinemas. In addition to Hollywood feature films, students will study non-Hollywood contemporary films that have proven successfully at the box offices either internationally and/or in their countries of production in order to study the critical elements that have contributed to the success of these films. Students will be exposed to box office hits from a wide variety of countries such as Spain, the UK, Japan, Korea, India and Australia. The analysis of these popular films will be contextualised in relation to relevant film theories such as genre theory, audience reception theories, studies of the economic development of new cinematic industries and the impact of global film distribution.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

Cinema, like all cultural products, is political in some way or other.  By deploying race, gender, and class as critical categories of reading film, this course's approach seeks to examine the political and ideological implications and assumptions of film art as a popular cultural medium.  Brief introductions to theories on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ideology, and class will provide the framework for the viewing of classic and contemporary film from different cinematic cultures.

What do films do? Why do they affect us the way they do? How do they make us think and act differently after we have experienced them? In this course, we will compare and contrast a number of films and philosophies to see what light their intersections and divergences shed on these questions. We will consider how the cinema relates to reality and how the cinema creates its own reality. As well, we will consider if any reality translates across time and space. We will examine the impact of filmic sound and vision on viewers' selves, consciousness, reactive thought processes, writing, and overall worldview. We will consider film theories and philosophies from classical, modern, and contemporary periods, and a large number of films from around the globe from the beginnings of filmmaking to today. In the end 'with luck and patience' we will understand better what happens at the interface of the cinema and its audience/viewers.
