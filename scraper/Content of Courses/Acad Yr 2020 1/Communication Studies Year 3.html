This course introduces the core components of motion picture production: idea, image, sound, and sequence.  In lecture, students will view movies and/or television programmes while considering a variety of questions.  What do we want to express?  Who is our audience?  How do we talk about images?  What compositional elements can we control or manipulate? How do we sequence images in order to evoke specific responses?  What happens when particular sounds and images are juxtaposed?  In related tutorials, students will explore these concepts with digital video cameras and nonlinear editing.

In Korean Cinema in the Global Context you will explore the history and theory of Korean cinema
- both South and North through the framework of national/transnational cinema discourse, auteur/genre theory, globalization, the North/South division system, and the problem of nation/state which evokes the question of identity. In this chronologically structured module, you will learn the cinema of Korea through a set of key films, directors, and dominant genres by lectures, screenings, and intensive and engaging discussions throughout the semester. Such critically and historically important films as The Aimless Bullet, The Housemaid, Shiri, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, My Sassy Girl, The Host, and Train to Busan will be screened. Through readings, discussions, in-class screenings, and presentations, our goal is to develop a broad understanding of Korean cinema and popular cultures exploring their wide-ranging impact and asking how they participate in the transnational production and circulation of culture, ideology, modernity, politics, and tradition in both regional and international contexts. It is not necessary for student to have prior knowledge of Korean cinema, and all are welcome.

This hands-on course exposes journalism students to the challenges of operating in another country and culture. Students work on stories that require a stint in the overseas location. They are expected to deliver stories of publishable/broadcastable quality. They will prepare for their field trips by attending seminars and doing independent research into the chosen location and identifying workable story ideas. They are also expected to help organise the logistics of the programme. While overseas, they are expected to function as working journalists, developing their story ideas within the practical constraints of operating in the field. They will complete their assignments back in Singapore. Admission to this course is by application and on merit.

A network is a collection of nodes that are connected in pairs by edges, which is the most powerful way of representing complex and dynamic systems like human societies. People, artifacts, events, and anything else around us can be viewed as nodes, and their interactions as edges. Friendship, love, ideas, information, money, power, or even disease pass through and are shaped by networks, and therefore, can be formulated and examined from a network perspective. This course will introduce the core concepts of network analysis and their applications to real- world problems. Its theoretical part will cover the fundamental theory of network analysis and review related works on social and communication networks. An equal weight of emphasis will be placed on developing practical skills for collecting and analyzing data to investigate empirical networks using computational programming languages, such as R and Python.

Social media services such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, have become an omnipresent class of communication that is continuously transforming the ways we communicate in everyday life. This course applies theories of communication to analyze the design and effects of social media on individual, social, and political outcomes. In doing so, we will consider topics that include social networks and contagion, identity management, memes, and viral trends, opinion formation and reinforcement, algorithms and bots, privacy and surveillance, rumors and misinformation, and civic engagement and mobilization. At the end of the course, the students will gain the expertise, critical reasoning ability, and analytical skills to efficiently create, consume, and evaluate the cognitive and sociopolitical effects of social media.

In order to sell a product, one must tell a story: one that engages the customer on a deeply emotional level. This is vital to modern branding, defining your company ethos and building long-term customer relationships. This course concentrates on visual storytelling for cinema, television and multi-media. 

Story depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles. 

Having instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.

The course therefore generates competency in storytelling for practitioners and researchers in the field of effective advertising. Enrollment is suited to advertising students, advertising industry practitioners, journalists, communications students as well as film, television and transmedia practitioners.

The performative documentary is a play of the reality often self-reflexive, in contrary to straightforward reports, facts, and observations. This course provides an overview of the aesthetic significance of the performative documentary film, its historical lineage, poetic endeavor, and contemporary significance. By situating in between the division of fact and fiction, you will explore the awareness for constructing the cinematic reality though the performative act, which creates different narrative structures as in the traditionally defined cinematic terms such as scenes, characters, and plots. These narrative structures will help you to explore the concepts of filmmaking and to develop the relevant technical skills. You will apply this knowledge in the realization of a documentary film project, which will become part of your individual practice and personal understanding of the world and its representation.
