The environment may be something many of us do not think very much about, but one thing is certain, it is an expansive issue covering diverse areas such as climate change, ozone depletion, pollution (air, land, marine), loss of biological diversity, corporate social responsibility, ethics and environmental management at international and national levels. In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.

This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.

As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future. Schemes such as the Singapore Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme for buildings will be studied, along with initiatives such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, and of course practical examples such as the design of Google's data centres will also be canvassed. The focus will be on the best practices in environmental design and performance of buildings in order for internal and external spaces to be utilised in a sustainable manner.

Business entities can benefit directly and indirectly if the living, working and playing spaces are environmentally sustainable in many ways, including but not limited to, productivity gains, corporate image, and leasing and retail value of buildings.

"Green Marketing" examines the role played by marketing in business sustainability and explores the influences and issues confronting marketing strategy decisions and actions on the marketing environment.
The course is designed in two main parts. The first part, comprising 7 seminars, explores theoretical frameworks and concepts that underpin the notion of corporate environmentalism. It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    

The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. 

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. 

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development skills in dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces students to key concepts and frameworks that are current in corporate sustainability. It holistically examines the strategies and policies businesses put in place to address the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic performance. The course begins by exploring how external global, political, societal, and technological factors influence business practices for sustainability. We will then take an in-depth look at major frameworks businesses use, in different industry contexts, to formulate sustainability strategies, and how these are implemented. Next, the course considers how firms interact with partners along the supply chain, and other external stakeholders, to manage their triple bottom line. The class will look at how companies track, measure, and monitor their progress, and how green reputations can be managed. We will finish by taking a look at the future of business and sustainability.

This course introduces participants to analyses, design, tools, techniques, and issues concerning the management of data. Data management is the foundation for organizations' business analytics; and for problem solving and decision-making. Participants will analyse a variety of business process, identify data requirements and develop an information system to support business processes and gather information for business analytics. In this course, participants will have an opportunity to apply their design and development competencies by working closely with non-profit organizations to implement an information systems prototype.

The learning goals of this course are to develop a range of competencies necessary for the domain of business analytics. These competencies include analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills, and technical and interpersonal skills. In-class exercises and the semester project will facilitate the internalization of these competencies. Through cooperative learning and real-world problems, participants will learn to work as consulting teams within a real operating organizational context. More importantly, participants of this course will learn how to learn new concepts, technologies and techniques.

Upon successful completion of this course, participants will have gained competencies to identify and analyze business-related problems, to use appropriate technologies to resolve these problems, to evaluate alternative solutions, to make appropriate recommendations and to develop a prototype of their recommended solution.

"Services represent the fastest growing sector of any developed economy. In the United States, this sector is responsible for nearly 75% of GDP and 80% of employment. Similarly, 75% of GDP and 70% of jobs in Singapore are generated by services. This trend persists in other industrialized nations. Moreover, these figures under-represent the actual role and significance of services in the economy because many manufacturing firms are increasingly involved in service-type jobs such as design, distribution, financial planning, customization, and after-sales services. That said, it is important for any manager (or student of management) to understand how services differ from manufacturing operations, and how toefficiently and effectively manage service operations.

In the first 7 weeks of the course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for designing, managing, analyzing, and improving service operations. Students will also learn to use analytical models and decision support tools for improving the operational effectiveness and efficiency in service organizations. Topics covered include Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Quality, Process Management, Project Management, Forecasting, Queue Management, Workforce Scheduling, and Capacity & Demand Management. 

The remaining weeks will focus on understanding the basics of service operations in the hospitality industry. Specific topics such as Front Office Management, F&B Management, Housekeeping, Facility Maintenance, and Revenue Management will be covered in this segment.

The goals of the course are:
1.   to provide an understanding and appreciation of the service functions of firms related to the
      Hospitality and Tourism industry,
2.   to understand the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to succeed in
      designing and managing service operations. The teaching method used is seminar style
      with a mix of lectures, in-class problem solving, discussions, video showing, and facility
      tours."
