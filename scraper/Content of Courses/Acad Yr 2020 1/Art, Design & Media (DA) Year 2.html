This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

In this course you will be introduced to the advanced techniques of character set-up and rigging as used in computer animation. You will be familiarized with concepts such as skeleton setup for characters and creatures of different forms and shapes, blend shape creation for facial animation, character driven simulations, and the establishment of a specific 3D pipeline. You will learn to explore practical scripting techniques used for rigs to be used in an animation scenario and become skilled in using these techniques for your own characters. 

How should a character be to be ready for animation?
The course begins with an introduction to the elemental units that constitute the basis for every rigging task. This includes understanding of anatomy and proper topology. This is then applied to various case studies; technical aspects such as skeleton and joint layout, interface creation, pipeline set up and technical choices will be discussed in class.

Building various part of a rig:
You will be introduced to various techniques that can help you to identify different anatomical parts and you will be guided in the understanding of commonalities between different creatures. Concepts such as the puppet rig and the deformation rig will be identified and discussed through practical examples. You will be encouraged to create simple automatic solutions and explore scripting to ease repetitive tasks. You will explore the need for dynamic solutions to create convincing character deformations and secondary motions.

Beyond traditional rigging:
You will receive an introduction to newly emerging and evolving rigging ideas that can be adapted to different animation formats such as video games VR and traditional key animation. The aim of this section is to illustrate the ever changing technological scenarios that continue to emerge as computer animation evolves due to increased sophistication and research development in the field.

Class assignments:
You will produce two projects and a final reel presentation that demonstrate how you can rig your own character using concepts explored in class and how that translates into  animation. Classes will include lectures, demonstrations, and activities that may be included in the assessment.

Typography Design II provides the opportunity to develop effective and innovative typographic practice, an indispensable foundation for other visual communication courses. You will examine the essential function that typography plays and develop the necessary skills and techniques to use typography in the support of effective visual communication.
Through lectures, in-class demonstrations, discussions, comprehensive projects and critiques, you will develop and apply principles of typography such as typographic identification, composition, layout, form, hierarchy, application to multi-page layout, and the enhancement of meaning and content.
Assignments are focused on applying and exploring the application of typography adhering to aesthetic and theoretical principles. The assignments allow you to focus on meaning, style and functionality as equal collaborators in effective typographic communication. Projects are intermediate to advanced in level and develop your existing skills in a systematic way throughout the semester. Essential components of this course include research, conceptual development, verbal articulation of visual solutions, production, and visual, verbal and written presentation. Typography Design II also includes the consideration of multiple languages and cultures.
