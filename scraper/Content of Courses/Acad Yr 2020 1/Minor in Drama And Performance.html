This course will introduce to students the fundamental principles of theatre and performance making as well as performance analysis. It examines how theatre is developed from a range of sources, and explores ways in which scripted text is transformed, interpreted and manipulated. Working with the body, voice and performance space as critical performance elements, a number of 20th century theatre-making methodologies will be explored and examined. These include the theories and practice of Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht. Where practice approaches are concerned, there will be a particular focus on Realist (Stanislavsky) and Epic (Brecht) dramaturgical and performance strategies. In addition, the course will also introduce two modes of performance analysis, semiotics and phenomenology, and other ways to `de-code' performances.

1	Defining Theatre, Drama and Performance. The Text-Performance Dialectic
2	Analysing Performance: Semiotics 
3	Analysing Performance: Phenomenology
4	Naturalism and Realist Theatre: Konstantin Stanislavski and Realist Acting
5	Epic Theatre: Bertolt Brecht and Brechtian Acting
6	Technical Theatre

The course will be an investigation of performance across a range of creative media and technologies. It will apply contemporary theories of performance, such as postmodernism and posthumanism, consciousness and the virtual double, telematics and telepresence, and liveness and mediatisation to critique and devise performance in contexts alternative to conventional theatre, with a primary focus on technology. The course seeks to inform students of the increasing use of technology in performance and encourages students to think critically about the various philosophical, aesthetic, cultural and critical issues arising from this interface of technology and theatre. 

1	History of Theatre, Performance and Technology
2	Postmodernism and Posthumanism
3	Forms of Digital Performance: Virtual Theatres, Mixed Reality Performance, Televisual Theatre, Cyborg Theatre
4	Theatre and Virtual Reality
5	Identities in Digital / Virtual Spaces
6	Liveness, Mediation and Presence
7	Telematics and Telepresence
8	Changing Role of the Spectator in Digital Performance

In this course students will work both individually and in small groups as they examine playwriting processes, script analysis and drama conventions. They will consider the role of the sole and collaborative playwright through writing exercises, improvisational and play-building techniques and research. Participants will examine some playwrights' methodologies and analyse a range of scripts that have been published as texts and used in performance. They read, watch and/or critique works by local playwrights as well international ones. A range of writing processes will be explored, leading to a variety of end-products ? for example, from scene-work to the development of treatment for multi-media performance; from dramaturgical and/or critical approaches to script analysis to the development of short playscripts. Participants will consider the place of playwriting in the broader context, including theatre in the community, drama education and theatre for special purposes.

1	Approaches to Script analysis and Close Reading of Plays
2	Developing Frame and Purpose in Playwriting
3	Structuring Plot and Situation in Story Development
4	Building Character and Shaping Relationships
5	Developing Dialogue and Critical Nuances 
6	Apprehending and Engaging with Key Themes and Contextually Relevant Issues 
7	Analysing Dialogue and Evaluating Aesthetic Value
8	Engaging with Rehearsal Process for Rehearsed Reading 

Attendance is compulsory and failure to comply with minimum attendance can result in failure.
