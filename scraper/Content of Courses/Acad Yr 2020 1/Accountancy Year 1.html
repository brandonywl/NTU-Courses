Communication Management Fundamentals introduces students to the crucial communication skills required of today's employees, young entrepreneurs and job hunters.
 
Achieving success in one's career is often symptomatic of his or her ability to develop cooperative work relationships, collaborate with and across teams, convey ideas clearly, concisely and convincingly, and listen skilfully. More than ever before, the ability to communicate effectively determines an employee's capacity to thrive in his or her career and to be in demand by employers. Entrepreneurs, alike, must also communicate well in order to articulate and present their ideas to customers, suppliers, the government, and other partners in the business ecosystem.

This course is structured to hone students' business communication skills, especially to prevail in an employment situation and to communicate positive-informative messages at work or in business overall. Students will be assessed on their ability to devise clear communication strategies, write effectively, prepare and deliver compelling oral presentations, and share and address feedback.

The importance of social media and its profound impact on the way people communicate today will also be explored as will be the most effective manner in which such platforms are harnessed for employees and businesses alike.

Specifically, this course aims to develop students' skills in communication management: writing, speaking, listening, and working in teams. The three main objectives of the course are the following:

1. Written communication: Students will learn to strategize and organize a positive-informative
    message in a professional, high quality business document by effectively adapting to the
    contextual requirements and the needs of the given audience.

2. Social media communication: Students will explore and critique good practices for personal
    and/or company image management to better understand the various risks and opportunities
    presented by social media to both individuals and organizations.
 
3. Oral communication: Students will learn to deliver professional, high-quality presentations,
    demonstrate appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication skills, and develop
    compelling content.
