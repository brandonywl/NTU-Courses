This course introduces participants to analyses, design, tools, techniques, and issues concerning the management of data. Data management is the foundation for organizations' business analytics; and for problem solving and decision-making. Participants will analyse a variety of business process, identify data requirements and develop an information system to support business processes and gather information for business analytics. In this course, participants will have an opportunity to apply their design and development competencies by working closely with non-profit organizations to implement an information systems prototype.

The learning goals of this course are to develop a range of competencies necessary for the domain of business analytics. These competencies include analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills, and technical and interpersonal skills. In-class exercises and the semester project will facilitate the internalization of these competencies. Through cooperative learning and real-world problems, participants will learn to work as consulting teams within a real operating organizational context. More importantly, participants of this course will learn how to learn new concepts, technologies and techniques.

Upon successful completion of this course, participants will have gained competencies to identify and analyze business-related problems, to use appropriate technologies to resolve these problems, to evaluate alternative solutions, to make appropriate recommendations and to develop a prototype of their recommended solution.

Most organizations are data rich and information poor. The large volumes of data in an organization are 'oilfields' rich in information content that are pending extraction with the right tools and models. Analytics involves the art of data exploration, visualization, communication and the science of analyzing large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and useful insights to support decision-making. The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to various techniques available to extract useful insights from the large volumes of data. At the end of the course, students will not only see the substantial opportunities that exist in the business analytics realm, but also learn techniques that allow them to exploit these opportunities. This course focus on the use of open source R software, which is one of the key analytics software used in various industries and a critical skillset required in the job market for analytics and data science professionals.

Learning Objective
To learn analytical techniques in operations at a more advanced level. Current course builds on the understanding of basic operations and process analytics covered in BE1401 Business Operations & Processes with a focus on building the "lean" perspective in operations. Lean operations refers to the approaches that center on the elimination of waste in all forms coupled with smooth, efficient flow of materials and information throughout the value chain to obtain faster customer response, higher quality and lower costs.

Mastery of this course will require the student to be able to:

1.	appreciate the key principles/approaches of lean operations including waste elimination, increased speed and response, improved quality and reduced cost 

2.	gain an understanding of the methodologies, tools and techniques necessary for analyzing, implementing, managing and continuously improving lean operations in both manufacturing and service industries. 

3.	develop an appreciation of applications of Toyota Production System, Value Stream Mapping, Pull Systems, Lean thinking in banking and healthcare operations. 

4.	use simulation for modeling and analyzing real life systems

5.	communicate ideas/ insights of business/operations analytics solutions


Content

Topics covered in the course include Toyota Production System, Lean Principles, Value Stream Mapping, Pull Systems, Lean thinking in banking and healthcare operations, and use of simulation for modeling and analyzing real life systems. The course will use a mix of lectures, case studies, and problem solving exercises, to introduce the students to the latest tools, techniques, issues and strategies in operations management.
