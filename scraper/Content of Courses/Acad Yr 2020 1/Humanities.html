This course is a continuation of the previous two Arabic courses offered by CML.  The course consolidates and extends the skills acquired on Arabic Language Levels 1 and 2 (ie, LA9001 and LA9002 respectively).  In this course, the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LA9002 are strengthened and expanded, enabling students to express themselves better in their written and oral expressions using the past, present and future tenses.  The course will enable learners to use Modern Standard Arabic in various real life situations and further enhance their ability in the four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The course teaches students to express themselves effectively in everyday communicative interactions beyond basic survival requirements.  It enables students to use a range of complex phrases and sentence structures as well as build on their vocabulary and idiomatic expressions.  It also further develops students' ability in reading and writing in the Arabic writing system so that they can successfully read and write.  Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex audio and written texts.

This German course is a continuation of the previous three courses offered by CML. In this course the fourth case (Genitive) is introduced and the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LG9003 are strengthened and expanded, enabling extensive written and oral expression in past, present and future tenses. Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex texts (reading and listening), which will enable a more complex and diverse understanding and use of the language in a variety of daily situations and discussions. 

Although the course develops all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) a special emphasis is placed on the active language production, especially the oral aspect. Audio-visual materials are used extensively and German is used almost exclusively as the language of instruction in the classroom.  

This course is equivalent to Level A2.2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and it prepares students to sit for the official external examination Start Deutsch 2 (SD2). The examination is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the German Language, issued and recognized by the German government and conducted at the Goethe Institut Singapur.

This course is a progression from the Level 2 course. In this course, students are introduced to a more advanced level of sentence construction and patterns.

Any student, who has successfully passed Spanish Language Level 1 (or equivalent), is eligible to take this course. It is a continuation of the previous level, where more verb tenses (present progressive and imperative) are introduced along with extensive vocabulary, grammar and expressions. This course mainly focuses on communication, where audio-visual materials play a more important role than written materials. Students are supposed to have a basic knowledge of the language in order to be able to cope with this level. 

Throughout the course, students will learn to use more complex grammar and structures to express actions such as asking for a favour, and giving commands and suggestions. They will also be able to create dialogues based on real-life situations (buying food and clothes, visiting the doctor, asking for and giving directions, ordering food at a restaurant). Issues about Hispanic culture will be used for listening comprehension and oral interaction to help students to increase their knowledge and gain a better understanding of this rich culture.
