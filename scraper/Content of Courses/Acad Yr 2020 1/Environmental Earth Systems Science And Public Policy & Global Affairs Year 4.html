This intensive field-based course introduces you to map interpretation and geological field mapping. In class, you will learn how to extract geological data from a geological map and how to make a cross-section. You will also be introduced to way-up and fault kinematic indicators. In the field, in small groups, you will map, at a scale of 1:10,000, an area showing lithologic and structural similitudes with Singapore. You will learn how to identify, describe and name lithostratigraphic units, how to position and extrapolate geological contacts, and how to present and interpret the obtained field information in a formal geologic report. Training in the construction and analysis of geological maps is an elemental activity to any geoscientist.

Microbial communities are the life support system of our biosphere. Microorganisms date back to the origin of life on Earth and they will likely exist well beyond any future extinction events. They can be found in every environment on Earth that is occupied by macroscopic organisms and are the unique life forms in `extreme? environments (e.g. deep sea vents, earth interior). This is an introductory course that will explore how microbes play key roles in and support the complex ecosystems we find in our biosphere. Through the lectures and lab tutorials, Microbes on natural ecosystems will provide you with background knowledge on fundamentals of microbiology, origin and diversity of microbial world, common methods to study microbes in their environment, how microorganisms control the chemistry of Earth, how microorganisms affect and will be affected by global climate change and how conservation biologists and microbial scientists can work together to preserve our biosphere. By the end of this course, you will appreciate and understand the importance of microbial processes to maintain a healthy global ecosystem. This course will be also open to graduate students who wish to improve and/or overview their knowledge on microbiology and microbial ecology.

This course is designed to introduce students the principles of chemistry related to geology and their applications to understand processes taking place on and within the Earth. By the end of the course, students should become familiar with the basic geochemical tools, and be able to use these tools to solve, in a quantitative manner, some geological and environmental problems, for example, measuring geological time, unravelling the continental and oceanic evolutions, and understanding the current climate change.

Content
We will investigate large scale processes occurring in the geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and anthroposphere using major and trace element geochemistry and stable isotopes. We will discuss processes such as element and isotope fractionation, element transport and mixing as well as radiogenic isotopes and their application for geochronological purposes. Hands-on data collection and analysis will be core to the students learning experience and will be done during tutorials and assignments.

Upon arrival in the field,students will participate in basic orientation exercises including detailed
safety briefings. The main field course will take place in three different areas of eastern California. 

Mapping days
On each mapping day, students will participate in a morning briefing, head into the field area to
participate in mapping projects, and work on report writing or map production in the evening.
Students will participate in camp maintenance and food preparation on a rotating group basis.

Area 1- Cerro Gordo,CA
Students will map bedrock geology of a fold-and-thrust belt. They will identify rock types and their field relationships, construct cross sections at multiple scales,and create a geological map. Students will observe faults, folds, pervasive deformation structures,sedimentary sequences,and complex igneous units.

Area 2 - Panum Crater,CA
Students will map a young rhyolitic eruptive center.They will identify different eruptive units,
! observe and interpret ductile and brittle rock fabrics,and construct a conceptual model of the evolution of Panum Crater during its life cycle.

Area 3 - Lundy Canyon, CA
Students will map surficial sediments and geomorphic features related to multiple cycles of
glaciation, Pleistocene lake levelfluctuations,delta formation,and range-front normalfaulting.
They will create a detailed geomorphic-geological map and investigate the relationships between 1 peak glaciation,lake level high stand,and long-term uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Rest days
Approximately one day per week, students will participate in a short morning field exercise and
then travel into a nearby town to wash clothes,rest, and participate in voluntary short field
excursions in the region. After spending the night in proper accommodations, they will return to the field and participate in afternoon field work.

Final field tour
The last days of the field camp will be used for regional field excursions, which will challenge the
students to integrate their field experiences into an overarching picture of the geological evolution of the East Sierra Nevada region.

Camp participation
The essential skills of independent field work include the ability to cook, clean, perform tasks that benefit the camp as needed,and maintain good work ing relationships with other camp members. Students will participate in food preparation, cooking, and dish washing on a rotating group basis.

The weekly arrangement for the course will be 2 h lectures and in-class problem solving + 1 h tutorials with short student presentations and literature discussions. Each week will cover a new topic or aspect of global change ecology. The main focus will be on how climate change effects ecological processes, in a wide range of different ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. The effects of global change phenomena such as CO2 fertilization (e.g. effects on plant growth and interactions), N pollution (e.g. plant mineral nutrition, mycorrhizal interactions, soil nutrient availability), pollution of aquatic systems, ocean acidification, land use change (e.g. deforestation and habitat loss), and climate warming on ecological interactions both between different organisms and organisms and their environment. We end the course by looking at how multiple global change drivers can give a more realistic view of net ecosystem effects. Researchers methods for studying ecosystem effects of global change phenomena will be considered, as well as areas in need of further study. (Biodiversity loss and invasive species will not be covered in depth as they are major components of the course Current Issues in Ecology).

Since the 1950s, the `great acceleration' in human induced impacts on the environment has heralded the new epoch of the Anthopocene. The increasing global population, combined with rising incomes, means the world's environmental and natural resources are under significant pressure. Management of these environmental pressures in a way which ensures sustainability is now a priority in many environmental conventions and agreements. This course will provide in depth knowledge on techniques that can be used to quantify and value environmental resources, and the management strategies that can be implemented for different systems. An understanding of these processes is essential for Environmental Science majors who wish to work in consultancy positions, government bodies, NGOs or private companies in this field.

It is no longer news that more than half of the world's population are living in urban areas and by 2050, 66 percent of the world will be according to United Nations' projection. Cities are growing in size and in presence! Literature about cities and urbanism proliferates as new fads of urbanism ebb and flow. With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment.

This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research.  The course content is deliberately multi-disciplinary, reflecting the rich and vast interest in the planning and development of cities. 

This course is for students who are keen to further engage in a critical inquiry of cities and discussing about what a good city is, beyond the basic content offered in HU1002: Introduction to Urban Planning and HU2002: Urban Life and Urban Planning. The course is crafted with the aim to allow students to co-produce and co-own the course content that they find valuable in informing their interests about the subject matter, and their graduation research projects.

This course will introduce you to the politics and policies of food in several countries, international organisations, and across time. Food is fundamentally essential to our physical existence, but it is also intensely cultural, with socially constructed behaviour and preferences that are change-resistant even in the presence of new knowledge, policies, and practices. How have different historical, social, economic, political, and institutional factors contributed to shaping national and international food policy outcomes? In this course, we begin with a heuristic analytical framework that enables you to study how interests, ideas, instruments, and institutions interact and affect the formation, development, and implementation of national and international food policy decisions. This course is organised around four themes: politics of food identity; globalisation or glocalisation; politics of food scandals; and international politics of food. By taking this course, you will learn how food is a powerful lens to understand contemporary politics and policies beyond consumption and nutrition.

This course introduces you to Urban Planning as a process and practice that shapes the development of our urban life. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized and our ecosystem becomes more fragile, the need for proper management of urban land through sensible land use planning has become ever more critical. In this course, we will learn about the important processes that shape our urban past, present and futures, including urbanization and the historical development of cities. These processes form an epistemic context upon which the study of urban planning will be introduced. We will discuss about the relevance of urban planning as part of urban governance, including its scope of practice, the agencies and institutions involved in the planning process in different cities, and in Singapore.
