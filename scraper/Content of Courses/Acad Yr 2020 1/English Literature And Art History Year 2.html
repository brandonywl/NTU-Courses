This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

This course is an experiential exploration of the ways in which everyday lives in a city like Singapore are structured by power, possibility and psychogeography. Students will interrogate the ways public and private spaces such as housing estates, public and corporate institutions, school campuses, city streets and shopping malls structure the individual imagination. They will then explore how these spaces become infused with a myriad of personal stories, memories, fictions, poetics and possibilities.

Students are reminded that ADM rules on attendance and plagiarism are in operation within all ADM courses as laid out in the ADM Student handbook http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentADM/Documents/ADMStudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf.

This course is foundational for more advanced art historical studies. It seeks to initiate critical reflection on 'art' and 'art history' as variable constructs subject to shifting matrixes of interconnected factors and forces. Based on a range of visual and textual materials from the pre-modern to the contemporary, the East and the West, the 'North' and the 'South', this course investigates the ways of seeing, representing, interpreting and thinking about 'art' and 'art history'. The first part of the course examines pictorial strategies adopted by image-makers from different periods and parts of the world; the second part explores a selection of art historical theories from Europe, East and South Asia. This learning will provide a conceptual framework for further, in-depth studies in global Art History.

This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings? to our eyes; analyze what Jocho?s Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

This course is intended to deepen and widen your pre-existing knowledge of Asian or Buddhist art, and to develop critical frameworks for rethinking prevailing canons of Buddhist art. It covers a selection of artefacts, sites and works of art from over two millennia from ca. 300BCE to the 21st century. The geographical scope mirrors the internationalisation of Buddhism, from South Asia to East, Southeast Asia, and the Western world, since the first millennium. We ask: how have Buddhist teachings been interpreted by image-makers over space and time, and how have the representations been subsequently experienced, read and used, and what makes 'Buddhist art' 'Buddhist' and 'art'? These studies will provide a basis for further in-depth studies of Buddhist Art.

This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

This course covers over one thousand years of English writing, from Anglo-Saxon to Neoclassical literature. We will focus primarily on the relationship between ?form? and ?history? in seeking to understand this literature, where ?form? refers to a given text?s genre or mode (e.g., ?revenge tragedy?), its linguistic and narrative characteristics, and so on, while ?history? means both material and cultural formations as these change through time. While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature?from deconstruction to queer theory?might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works. The course will touch upon a number of ?big? themes in English literature, with particular emphasis on the rise of individualism and the impact of the Reformation on early-modern culture and thought.

This is a comprehensive introduction to medieval English literature, with a focus on the Middle English period. Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic "Age of Faith" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required.

The term 'renaissance,' meaning 'rebirth', was popularized by Jacob Burckhardt in the 19th century, and has since then been inseparable from the idea that a new kind of European individual emerged between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, along with humanism, capitalism, protestantism, empirical science and European imperialism. Burckhardt was writing about Catholic Italy, however, and the individuals this course will examine lived in England, under absolutist Tudor and Stuart monarchs, during a time when the Protestant reformation was giving rise to new democratic ideologies. These writers witnessed the systematic demolition of English Catholicism, and of the feudal society that it entailed, by Henry VIII and his children. The ensuing tension between monarchy and democracy resulted in the English civil war, a conflict which produced, among other things, Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost. The texts chosen for this course demonstrate that, despite the excitement produced by new discoveries in art, science and geography, the emotion of loss suffuses the literature of the century leading up to the civil war, and this must qualify any notion that the history of the English renaissance is an unambiguous progress-narrative. Rather, it is a period fraught with contradictions, contradictions that enabled the production of some unique works of literary art.

The Age of Sensibility and Romanticism witnessed a surge of interest in emotional responsiveness, imagination, and individual subjectivity. These inward explorations coincided with a series of political, cultural, and philosophical debates that reconfigured public life and continue to shape our modern sensibilities. Taking taxonomy as an overall theme, this course begins by delineating approaches to perception, articulation, and emotion that emerged during the long eighteenth century. Following this, we will examine seminal texts by William Wordsworth and Jane Austen before embarking on a series of thematic lectures on the city, education and children?s books, and the pleasures and pains of opium. In order to reflect the diversity of print culture between 1740 and 1820, this course explores a variety of primary source material. Literary works, such as poetry and fiction, will be examined alongside pedagogical theory and discourses on elocution and aesthetics. Throughout the course, we will consider our own experience as readers of eighteenth-century and Romantic texts in relation to reading practice during the period. How did rising literacy rates and innovations in textual production and circulation influence literary form, genre, and taste?

This module examines select literary and dramatic/theatre works in the light of the changes in Singapore literature and culture since independence in 1965 to the present, with an emphasis on the 1980s to the 2000s. The central context of the dramatic changes lie in changes in modernization policy in Singapore - in   the   1970s,   from   a   'pragmatic'   and   culturally   philistine   modernization   that   sought   to homogenize/standardize culture and the cityscape in the name of economic development, to a 1990s- present modernization that (in contrast) desires Singapore to be a more hip 'global city for the arts' (a 1992 government-policy phrase). The changing contexts are as important as the texts to be examined. Why was the Singapore state not interested in what can be called 'high culture' or 'serious art' in the 1960s & 1970s? The emphasis then appeared to be on culture conceived of as 'racial' and ethnic culture  - and such ethnic-cultural identities are effectively transformed by the urban change and state-led social engineering. What  sort of literary and other cultural  responses were there in relation to the state's
policies on culture and racial management in the 1980s? What happened in the state's thinking on culture in the 1990s that led a (supposed move away from a philistinism) to a desire to invest in the arts? How did creative-cultural producers relate to these unexpected changes? Such will be the questions that this module will address.

This module approaches its topic through a variety of selected writings in English or in English translation.   Largely that of women?s writings, texts to be studied range from the non-fictional such as letters and biographies, to poetry, short stories and novels from various countries in the region ? Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines.  Situating the writings in their respective socio-cultural, political and historical contexts, the course will discuss issues such as the conditions of literary production and reception; whether the description ?Southeast Asian? is merely a geographical category, culturally embedded, or a valid and significant construct based on a shared, and in the case of the women?s writings, a gendered ?Southeast Asian women?s? experience.  The course will examine the extent to which the experience was precipitated by colonial and post-colonial urgencies; the extent to which these women?s narratives, and representations of their experience are feminist, and inescapably inscribed by patriarchal structures; and the usefulness of Western feminist and postcolonial theories in approaching these texts.

Over the last few decades, South Asian literature in English has achieved a global prominence that is unique among postcolonial literatures. In this module we will be tracing the historical development of South Asian writing from the colonial period to the present-day ? exploring, among other things, the impact of British colonial policy on its formation, the ongoing debate surrounding its use of an `imperial? language, and the reasons behind its phenomenal popularity. We will also be discussing some of the social and political issues with which this literature engages, whether it be the caste system, communal violence, or the vagaries of the postcolonial nation-state. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the Bollywood film Lagaan, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

As we read we will consider the formulization of an "American" "Early" "Literature". Whatconstitutes "America" before 1789? Are these texts "literary"? Does our study of these textsrequire a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only Englishlanguage texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these ?secondary? histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?

This course explores shifting attitudes towards childhood, children's literature, and their attendant
critical and theoretical discourses from the nineteenth-century to the present. You will examine the lingu istic and narrative strategies that adult writers, illustrators, and filmmakers deploy in their attempts to speak to, and for, young audiences, and the assumptions that we, as adults, bring to our encounters with historical and contemporary children's texts.

Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema, semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera, Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

Cinema, like all cultural products, is political in some way or other.  By deploying race, gender, and class as critical categories of reading film, this course's approach seeks to examine the political and ideological implications and assumptions of film art as a popular cultural medium.  Brief introductions to theories on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ideology, and class will provide the framework for the viewing of classic and contemporary film from different cinematic cultures.

Tracing its origins from nineteenth-century writing on the possibilities and threats both of technology and the newly established sciences to its generic reconstruction and intertextual revisiting over the centuries, the analysis of its most prominent as well as of recently rediscovered works aims to illustrate how science fiction has transformed literature and film. In this, it also seeks to map the genre's most defining topoi: travel through space, time, and parallel universes; experimental technology; alien life; testing the boundaries of the mind and manipulating the body (cloning). Science fiction has always been experimental in its technique as well as in its critique of social, psychological, and scientific definitions of selfhood, and its study taps into encompassing explorations of epistemological as well as ontological anxieties.

This module explores a diverse range of Latin American literatures - including works from Brazil,
Argentina, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic. It will offer an historical account of the emergence
and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and
political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the transcultural  'contact zone' created by colonialism, the  ideological and socioeconomic consequences of slavery, and the enduring conflict
between tradition and modernity. We will also  be discussing the early chronicles of discovery  and
conquest, the significance of magical realism as a mode of representation, and the subgenre of the
dictator novel

This course examines the intersections of gender, sexuality, place, ability, status, race, and class in the cultural construction of bodies and how we respond to bodies.  It focuses on the relationship between the normal and the abject to highlight how that relationship influences which bodies arouse our desire and move us in disgust.  We will consider both mainstream and independent filmmaking and other visual arts in order to more fully investigate the rhetorics of the wondrous, the sentimental, the exotic, the realistic, the inscrutable, and the repulsive in regard to these bodies.  More than just looking at 'images of' - and -identities,- we will concentrate on theories of the production and perpetration of the bodies we see and how we see them.

Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World
War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.'
There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not
identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their	shared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as	 you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.

Course Content
The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the
audience to confront the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Each week, we will look	closely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in	1, class. The course will provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time, humour and suffering.

HW0105 is a foundational course with the broad aim of enabling Humanities and Social Sciences students to analyze texts, develop compelling research questions, and do research to create their own arguments. The basic premise of the course is that effective writing is contingent on critical thinking, reading and writing. You will be exposed to a variety of texts to encourage you to critically evaluate  and  write about  issues  from  multiple  perspectives  before you develop your  own arguments. The need to consider the rhetorical situation and ethical issues is emphasised as you go through the process of planning, writing, and critically revising your own texts based on individual feedback. The course is designed specifically for the needs of NTU students and many of the texts and study topics have a Singapore focus.
